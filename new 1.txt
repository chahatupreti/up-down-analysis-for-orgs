Found induced in !Series_summary	"We previously observed that formation of aorta and innominate artery atherosclerotic lesions in the intima of hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient mice but not wild-type mice was accompanied by a marked age-dependent adventitial T cell infiltration. As the mice aged, adventitial T cells formed T/T cell-, T/B cell-, and T/B/dendritic cell aggregates adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions. Some of the adventitial infiltrates formed large clusters of various immune cells including T cells, B cells (centrocytes, follicular mantle cells), dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells with preferential formation in the suprarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. These data demonstrated that the immune lineage cell composition of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitia were distinct: The macrophage-foam cell-, T cell-, and SMC-dominated cell composition of atherosclerosis lesions versus the presence of immune cells capable of carrying out antigen-dependent T cell-driven humoral immune responses in the adventitia also indicated that immune reactions carried out in lesions or the adventitia are fundamentaly different. To distinguish between immunity-regulating genes in atherosclerosis lesions versus the adventitia, a combination of microarray profiling and laser capture microdissection was used. Stringent filters revealed 1163 differentially up-regulated probesets in apoE-/- mouse aortae at 78 weeks (w) versus 6 w. A fuzzy c-means cluster algorythm identified 2 clusters that significantly differed in their slope angles between time points: An apparent atherosclerosis cluster consisted of 771 probesets and an apparent adventitia cluster consisted of 392 probesets. Up-regulated genes at 32 w mirrored the influx of monocyte/macrophages into intima lesions whereas genes up-regulated between 32-78 w mirrored adventitial inflammation. To segregate both clusters into separate gene ontology (GO) molecular function groups, we determined statistically significant up-regulation (unpaired Student t-test; p < 0.05) between 6-32 w for the atherosclerosis cluster and between 32-78 w for the adventitia cluster. Among others, GO molecular function terms cytokine activity, cytokine binding, and immunoglobulin binding in the atherosclerosis cluster and cytokine activity, chemokine receptor activity, and antigen binding in the ATLO cluster suggested candidate genes in relation to inflammation triggered by macrophages or adventitia infiltration, respectively. Among other prototype atherosclerosis genes such as Itgax (complement receptor 4), Cd68, Lysz (lysozyme), Vcam1, and Icam1, the atherosclerosis cluster showed markedly overrepresented prototype macrophage/foam cell genes regulating inflammation in cytokine activity (GO: 0005125): Spp1 (osteopontin) and Il6; in cytokine binding (GO: 0019955) Cd74, Il10rb, Ccr2, and Ccr5; and in immunoglobulin binding (GO: 00119865) the proinflammatory galactose-binding lectin Lgals3, as well as genes in scavenger receptor activity and lipid transporter activity. By contrast, the adventitia cluster showed overrepresented genes regulating B cell recruitment, B cell maturation, germinal center formation, and autoimmunity in cytokine activity including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, in CXC chemokine receptor activity the secondary lymphoid organ counterreceptor of CXCL13 Blr1 (also known as Cxcr5), Cxcr3, and Cxcr6; and in antigen binding several histocompatibility-2 loci and various markedly expressed immunoglobulin genes. As embryonic lymph node development and tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis share common features signal intensities of genes specifying the GO molecular function term lymph node development (GO: 0048535) were examined in arrays prepared from wild-type and apoE-/- aortae. These results showed that Id2, Nfkb1, and Ltbr were constitutively expressed at significant levels in aortae of both mouse genotypes whereas other genes including Lta, Ltb, Glycam1, and the two lymphorganogenic genes Cxcl13 and Ccl21 were induced at 78 w in apoE-deficient aortae only. Thus, genes expressed by macrophage-foam cells and genes regulating ATLO neogenesis, embryonic lymph node development, or B cell maturation were constitutively expressed in the arterial wall in both genotypes or emerged in a stepwise fashion at 32 w and 78 w. To verify microarray signal intensity data, separate aortae extracts were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and apoE-deficient mice at 32 and 78 w. These data showed that array signal values accurately reflected gene transcripts. Cell lineage analyses of the adventitial infiltrate and kinetic aorta microarray- and QRT-PCR analyses thus provided circumstantial evidence that immune responses in atherosclerosis intima lesions and the adventitia were distinct. To examine this possibility further, we selected areas of the abdominal aorta burdened with advanced lesions and separated lesions and corresponding adventitial infiltrates of 78 w old apoE-deficient mice by laser dissection microscopy. In addition, adventitiae of aorta segments that were not associated with adjacent lesions and adventitiae of wild-type mice were prepared. Consistent with the lack of a major adventitial leukocyte infiltration, wild-type adventitiae showed gene expression levels that were similar to lesion-free adventitiae of apoE-deficient mice indicating that atherosclerotic lesions directly affected adventitial inflammation in a segmental fashion. Stringent filter criteria identified genes that were differentially expressed in adventitiae and atherosclerotic lesions. Statistical analyses of overrepresented genes in GO molecular function or biological process groups were particularly instructive in cytokine activity, cytokine binding, antigen processing and presentation as well as in lymph node development. Thus, adventitiae in aorta segments with associated atherosclerotic lesions in cytokine activity showed overrepresentation of genes known to be associated with tertiary lymphoid organ formation including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, whereas atherosclerotic lesions showed overrepresentation of prototype atherosclerosis-associated genes Ssp1 (osteopontin), Bmp4 (bone morphogenic protein 4), and Cxc3cl1 (fractalkine); in cytokine binding adventitiae showed overrepresentation of receptors implicated in B cell immunity and autoimmunity including Brl1 (counterreceptor for CXCL13), Ccr7, Tnfrsf4, and Cxcr3 whereas lesions showed overrepresentation of inflammatory mediator receptors including Tnfrs1b, Tgfbr1, and Il7r; moreover, in antigen processing and presentation, adventitiae showed overrepresentation of several histocompatibility loci; additional adventitial gene expression overrepresentations were observed in lymph node development (Fas, SpiB, Ltb, Flt3) whereas lesions showed expression of prototype macrophage genes including Tlr4, Tgfb1, and Tgfb2.  These data provide comprehensive topographical transcriptome information in adventitial tissue adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions versus lesions and are expected to form the basis for future cell lineage expression analyses using single cell detection methodology including ISH."

Chronic TNFalpha exposure has been shown to down-modulate T cell responses.  In a mouse T cell hybridoma model, TNFalpha attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.  We have confirmed that chronic TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cells, respectively.  The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness."

Found exposure in !Series_summary	"Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology. In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver. The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner. The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways. p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD."

To search for GATA-1-regulated erythroid miRNAs, we used the Gata-1– erythroblast line G1E.  These cells proliferate in culture as immature erythroid precursors and undergo terminal maturation when GATA-1 activity is restored.  G1E-ER4 is a sub-line stably expressing an estrogen-activated form of GATA-1 (GATA-1 fused to the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor).  Treatment of G1E-ER4 cells with estradiol induces a GATA-1-regulated program of gene expression with concomitant cellular maturation.  We used a microarray to evaluate the expression of 292 different miRNAs in G1E-ER4 cells at 0 versus 24 hours after GATA-1 activation.

Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The development of the epidermis, a stratified squamous epithelium, is dependent on the regulated differentiation of keratinocytes. Differentiation begins with the initiation of stratification, a process tightly controlled through proper gene expression. AP-2γ is expressed in skin and previous research suggested a pathway where p63 gene induction results in increased expression of AP-2γ which in turn is responsible for induction of K14. This study uses a conditional gene ablation model to further explore the role of AP-2γ in skin development.  Mice deficient for AP-2γ exhibited delayed expression of p63, K14, and K1, key genes required for development and differentiation of the epidermis. In addition, microarray analysis of E16.5 skin revealed delayed expression of additional late epidermal differentiation genes: filaggrin, repetin and secreted Ly6/Plaur domain containing 1, in mutant mice. The genetic delay in skin development was further confirmed by a functional delay in the formation of an epidermal barrier. These results document an important role for AP-2γ in skin development, and reveal the existence of regulatory factors that can compensate for AP-2γ in its absence."

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma r is 8 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Rosiglitazone (Rosi), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, activates the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg). This activation causes bone loss in animals and humans, at least in part due to suppression of osteoblast differentiation from marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In order to identify mechanisms by which PPARg2 suppresses osteoblastogenesis and promotes adipogenesis in MSC, we have analyzed the PPARg2 transcriptome in response to Rosi. A total of 4,252 transcriptional changes resulted when Rosi (1 uM) was applied to the U-33 marrow stromal cell line, stably transfected with PPARg2 (U-33/g2), as compared to non-induced U-33/g2 cells. Differences between U-33/g2 and U-33 cells stably transfected with empty vector (U-33/c) comprised 7,928 transcriptional changes, independent of Rosi. Cell type-, time- and treatment-specific gene clustering uncovered distinct patterns of PPARg2 transcriptional control of MSC lineage commitment. The earliest changes accompanying Rosi activation of PPARg2 included adjustments in morphogenesis, Wnt signaling, and immune responses, as well as sustained induction of lipid metabolism. Expression signatures influenced by longer exposure to Rosi provided evidence for distinct mechanisms governing the repression of osteogenesis and stimulation of adipogenesis. Our results suggest interactions that could lead to the identification of a “master” regulatory scheme controlling osteoblast differentiation. "

estrogen receptor r is 12 
Found treated in !Series_summary	"Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that modify key residues in histones to regulate chromatin architecture, and play a vital role in cell survival, cell cycle progression, and tumorigenesis. To understand the function of Hdac3, a critical component of the N-CoR/SMRT repression complex, a conditional allele of Hdac3 was engineered. Given the vital role of HDAC3 in normal cells and in the generation and treatment of various cancers, a conditional deletion of Hdac3 was engineered in mice. The deletion of Hdac3 in the germ line yielded very early embryonic lethality. Therefore, mouse embryonic-derived fibroblasts (MEFs) containing the Hdac3 conditional allele were used to examine the function of Hdac3 in cell viability and in cell cycle control. Given the links between Hdac3 and transcriptional repression, we used oligonucleotide micro arrays to examine RNA isolated from control and Cre recombinase expressing MEFs to define the changes in gene expression upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Initially, we compared RNA from Ad-Cre infected Hdac3FL/+ and Hdac3FL/- MEFs and then we extended the analysis to Hdac3FL/- MEFs expressing Cre-ER (tamoxifen responsive Cre-estrogen receptor fusion protein).  When the gene expression of ethanol-treated (vehicle) and tamoxifen-treated MEFs was compared at 72 hr post-induction, 83 genes were induced and 111 genes were down-regulated at least 1.5-fold upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Approximately, 48 genes were up-regulated in both Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs at the 72 hr time point.  The majority of the affected genes were associated with signal transduction and metabolism. Overall, few of the up-regulated genes at the 72hr time point in Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs are associated with apoptosis or with cell cycle control. Thus, these metabolic regulatory genes may be “core” Hdac3-regulated genes, and alterations in gene expression are unlikely to trigger apoptosis. "

Using Irf-4,8-/- pre-B cells we demonstrate that two pathways converge to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, a process that is not simply activated by cell cycle exit. One pathway is directly dependent on IRF-4, whose expression is elevated by pre-BCR signaling.  IRF-4 targets the κ 3′ and λ enhancers to increase locus accessibility and positions a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other pathway is triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and results in activation of the κ intronic enhancer via binding of the transcription factor, E2A. Intriguingly, IRF-4 regulates the expression of CXCR4 and promotes the migration of pre-B cells in response to the chemokine CXCL12.

Found knockout in !Series_summary	"Beyond demonstrating a critical role for progesterone receptor signaling in normal mammary epithelial proliferation, the progesterone receptor knockout mouse disclosed the progesterone receptor along with its effector pathways as key determinants of mammary neoplastic progression.  Despite these advances, however, further progress in our mechanistic understanding of progesterone’s involvement in mammary morphogenesis and tumorigenesis is contingent upon defining the essential effector pathways responsible for transducing the progesterone signal into a mammary proliferative and/or pro-survival response.  Toward this goal, a judiciously chosen acute progesterone treatment regimen together with microarray methods was applied to the mammary gland of the normal mouse to uncover new effectors that operate immediately downstream of the progesterone mammary signal.  Examination of the resultant progesterone-responsive transcriptome disclosed “inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding 4” (Id4) as a molecular target acutely induced by progesterone in the murine mammary epithelium."

Leptin stimulates metalloproteinase activity in cultured human trophoblast and stimulates invasiveness of cultured mouse trophoblast.  The goal of the present study was to examine molecular mechanisms of this function in primary cultures of mouse trophoblast.  Leptin was found to stimulate the phosphorylation of MEK, but not STAT3.. It also increased levels of the protein SOCS3.  The ability of leptin to stimulate metalloproteinase activity was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but also by the vehicle inhibitor DMSO.  Microarray analysis revealed that leptin stimulated some genes associated with cell motility, such as Stmn1.  In addition, leptin appeared to inhibit changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast giant cells, including inhibition of members of the TGFß signaling pathway and of genes associated with endoreduplication.  However, feulgen staining revealed a loss of cells with low ploidy.  We conclude that leptin may be promoting trophoblast invasion by maintaining cells in an intermediate stage of differentiation."

granzyme B r is 12 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"IL-2 and IL-21 are closely related cytokines that might have arisen by gene duplication. Both cytokines promote the function of effector CD8+ T cells, but their distinct effects on antigen-driven differentiation of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector CD8+ T cells are not clearly understood. We found that antigen-induced expression of eomesodermin and maturation of naïve CD8+ T cells into granzyme B and CD44 expressing effector CD8+ T cells was enhanced by IL-2, but, unexpectedly, suppressed by IL-21. Furthermore, IL-21 repressed expression of IL-2Ra and inhibited IL-2-mediated acquisition of a cytolytic CD8+ T cell phenotype. Despite its inhibitory effects, IL-21 did not induce anergy, but instead potently enhanced the capacity of cells to mediate tumor regression upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, IL-2, surprisingly, impaired the subsequent anti-tumor function of transferred cells. Gene expression studies revealed a distinct IL-21-program that was characterized phenotypically by increased expression of L-selectin and functionally by enhanced anti-tumor immunity that was not reversed by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL-2. Thus, the efficacy of CD8+ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be influenced by opposing differentiation programs conferred by IL-2 and IL-21, a finding with important implications for the development of cellular cancer therapies."

Here, we report a strong but transient induction of miR-155 in mouse bone marrow after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated with granulocyte/monocyte (GM) expansion. Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease. These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress."

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"The reduced folate carrier (RFC1) is an integral membrane protein and facilitative anion exchanger that mediates delivery of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into mammalian cells.  Adequate maternal-fetal transport of folate is necessary for normal embryogenesis.  Targeted inactivation of the murine RFC1 gene results in post-implantation embryo lethality, but daily folic acid supplementation of pregnant dams prolongs survival of homozygous embryos until mid-gestation.  At E10.5 RFC1-/- embryos are developmentally delayed relative to wildtype littermates, have multiple malformations, including neural tube defects, and die due to failure of chorioallantoic fusion.  The mesoderm is sparse and disorganized, and there is a marked absence of erythrocytes in yolk sac blood islands.  Affymetrix microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR validation of the relative gene expression profiles in E9.5 RFC1-/- vs. RFC1+/+ embryos indicates a dramatic downregulation of multiple genes involved in erythropoiesis, and upregulation of several genes that form the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex.  Megalin protein expression disappears from the visceral yolk sac of RFC1-/- embryos, and cubilin protein is widely misexpressed.  Inactivation of RFC1 impacts the expression of several ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-amnionless-megalin complex that are involved in the maternal-fetal transport of folate, vitamin B12, and other nutrients, lipids and morphogens required for normal embryogenesis."

RP3 r is 5 
Found expressing in !Series_summary	"The RET/PTC3 (RP3) fusion gene is the most frequent mutation found in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). Several studies suggest that the RET/PTC rearrangement is an initiating event in tumorigenesis. E7 is an oncoprotein derived from the Human Papilllomavirus 16 (HPV16) responsible for most cervical carcinoma in women. We studied here the sequence of events leading to thyroid cancer in Tg-RP3 and Tg-E7 mice expressing the transgene exclusively in the thyroid under the control of thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter. Both transgenic mice develop thyroid hyperplasia followed by solid differentiated carcinoma in older animals. To understand the different steps leading to carcinoma, we analyzed thyroid gene expression in both strains at different ages (2, 6, 10 months) by microarray technology. Important biological processes were differentially regulated in the two tumor types. In E7 thyroids cell cycle was the most upregulated process; observation consistent with the huge size of these tumors. In RP3 thyroids immunity was the most significantly regulated process, as previously observed in microarray data on human PTC. Interestingly, other human PTC characteristics were also observed in RP3 but not in E7 mouse tumors: similar regulation of several human PTC markers, upregulation of many EGF-like growth factors and finally significant regulation of angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling-related genes. In summary we showed that RP3 contrary to E7 mouse tumors share several important genotypic characteristics with human PTC, observation reinforcing the validity of this model to study human thyroid tumorigenesis.

These animals have decreased frataxin levels and, by microarray analysis, show significant gene expression changes in several tissues. We treated KIKI mice with a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, compound 106, which substantially increases frataxin mRNA levels in cells from Friedreich ataxia individuals. Treatment increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in chromatin near the GAA repeat and restored wild-type frataxin levels in the nervous system and heart, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and semiquantitative western blot analysis. No toxicity was observed. Furthermore, most of the differentially expressed genes in KIKI mice reverted towards wild-type levels. "

leukemia inhibitory factor r is 7 
Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"During development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are generated from common neural precursor cells (NPCs). However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor STAT3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development."

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"TCE is a non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen in mouse, but not in rat or human. Extrapolation of data from laboratory animals to humans is difficult due to species-specific differences. To identify molecular pathways and biological changes responsible for species-specific differences in hepatocarcinogenesis, we analyzed gene expression profiles of livers from B6C3F1 mice and SD rats administered TCE by oral gavage once or repeatedly every 24 hrs for 14 days. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct clusters of transcriptional profiles in single- and repeated-dose mice and rats.  Pathway analysis showed differences in biological pathways between single- and repeated-dose mice and rats. Activation of the MAPK signaling cascade and ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitory function, as well as inhibition of TGF-beta signaling, were specific to mice and suggest a role in hepatocyte proliferation. Although pathological analysis showed no evidence of apoptosis, gene expression analysis revealed changes in apoptosis-related genes. In addition to the previously reported suppression of apoptosis, results in repeated-dose mice showed that toxicity induced by TCE in turn induces apoptosis."

Found null in !Series_summary	"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CBP/p300 in the activation of ß-catenin/TCF target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the TCF/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling revealed that FHL2 deficiency triggers a broad change of the cell cycle program that is associated with downregulation of several G1/S and G2/M cyclins, E2F transcription factors and DNA replication machinery, thus correlating with reduced cell proliferation. This change also involves downregulation of the negative cell cycle regulators, particularly INK4 inhibitors, which could counteract the decreased expression of cyclins, allowing cells to grow. Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."

To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of  C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes.  Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks.   In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice.

Previous studies have suggested effects on inflammation, proliferation, and vasoconstriction. The goal of this study was to determine which of these were supported by alterations in gene expression in serotonin transporter knockout mice. Methods: Eight week old normoxic mice with a 5-HTT knock-out (5HTT-/-) and their heterozygote(5HTT+/-) or wild-type(5HTT+/+) littermates had right ventricular systolic pressure(RVSP) assessed, lungs collected for RNA, pooled, and used in duplicate in Affymetrix array analysis. Representative genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Results: RVSP was normal in all groups. Only 124 genes were reliably changed between 5HTT-/- and 5HTT+/+ mice. More than half of these were either involved in inflammatory response or muscle function and organization; in addition, some matrix, heme oxygenase, developmental, and energy metabolism genes showed altered expression. Quantitative RT-PCR for examples from each major group confirmed changes seen by array, with an intermediate level in 5HTT+/- mice. Conclusions: These results for the first time show the in vivo effects of 5HTT knockout in lungs, and show that many of the downstream mechanisms suggested by cell culture and ex vivo experiments are also operational in vivo.  This suggests that the effect of 5HTT on pulmonary vascular function arises from its impact on several systems, including vasoreactivity, proliferation, and immune function."

Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice.

We focus here on the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7, a recently identified hematopoietic tumor suppressor that can target for degradation several important oncogenes including Notch1, c-Myc and cyclin E. We have generated conditional Fbw7 knock-out animals and inactivated the gene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Deletion of Fbw7 specifically and rapidly affects the HSC compartment in a cell-autonomous manner. Fbw7-/- HSCs show defective maintenance of quiescence, leading to impaired self-renewal and a severe loss of competitive repopulating capacity. Furthermore, Fbw7-/- HSC  are unable to colonize the thymus leading to a profound depletion of T cell progenitors. Deletion of Fbw7 in bone marrow stem cells and progenitors leads to the stabilization of c-Myc, a transcription factor previously implicated in HSC self-renewal. On the other hand, neither Notch1 nor cyclin E are stabilized in the bone marrow of Fbw7 deficient mice. Genome-wide transcriptome studies of Fbw7-/- HSC and hematopoietic progenitors indicate that Fbw7 controls, through the regulation of HSC cell cycle entry, the global transcriptional “signature” that is associated with the quiescent, self-renewing HSC phenotype."

Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor auto-up-regulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of BIM expression. Additionally, cotreatment with glucocorticoids induced Ccnd2 upregulation in the gut which protected mice from the intestinal secretory metaplasia typically induced by loss of NOTCH signaling. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL."

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

inducible nitric oxide synthase r is 3 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"microRNA (miRNA), recently identified, non-coding, small RNA, are emerging as key regulators in homeostasis of the immune system.  Therefore, aberrant expression of miRNA may be linked to immune dysfunction, such as in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.  In this study, we investigated the potential role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated regulation of innate immune responses, as indicated by upregulation of LPS-induced IFNg, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice.  We found that miR-146a, a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, was decreased in freshly-isolated splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice compared to placebo controls.  Increasing the activity of miR-146a significantly inhibited LPS-induced IFNg and iNOS expression in mouse splenic lymphocytes.  Further, miRNA microarray and Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that estrogen selectively upregulates/downregulates the expression of miRNA in mouse splenic lymphocytes.  miR-223, which is highly upregulated by estrogen, regulates LPS-induced IFNg, but not iNOS or nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes. Inhibition of miR-223 activity decreased LPS-induced IFNg in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice. Our data are the first demonstrating selective regulation of miRNA expression in immune cells by estrogen and are indicative of an important role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated immune regulation. "

progesterone receptor r is 4 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The lymphatic system is a common avenue for the spread of breast cancer cells and dissemination through it occurs at least as frequently as hematogenous metastasis. Approximately 75% of primary breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and the majority of these maintain receptor expression as lymph node (LN) metastases. However, it is unknown if ER function is equivalent in cancer cells growing in the breast and in the LNs. We have developed a model to assess estrogen responsiveness in ER(+) breast tumors and LN metastases. Fluorescent ER(+) MCF-7 tumors were grown in ovariectomized nude mice supplemented with estradiol. Once axillary LN metastasis arose, estradiol was withdrawn (EWD), for 1 or 4 weeks, or continued, to assess estradiol responsiveness. On EWD, proliferation rates fell similarly in tumors and LN metastases. However, estradiol-dependent ER down-regulation and progesterone receptor induction were deficient in LN metastases, indicating that ER-dependent transcriptional function was altered in the LN. Cancer cells from estradiol-treated and EWD primary tumors and matched LN metastases were isolated by laser capture microdissection. Global gene expression profiling identified transcripts that were regulated by the tissue microenvironment, by hormones, or by both. Interestingly, numerous genes that were estradiol regulated in tumors lost estradiol sensitivity or were regulated in the opposite direction by estradiol in LN metastases. We propose that the LN microenvironment alters estradiol signaling and may contribute to local antiestrogen resistance."

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Streptococcus pyogenes is a major causative agent of tonsillitis or pharyngitis in children, which can lead to more invasive infections and noninfectious sequellae. S. pyogenes can persist in tonsils, while one-third of children treated with antibiotics continue to shed streptococci and have recurrent infections. Mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) is functionally analogous to human oropharangeal lymphoid tissues. The innate immune responses of naïve cells from a mucosal site to S. pyogenes is not well described; therefore, we infected C57BL/6 mice intranasally with 108 CFU S. pyogenes. Transcriptional responses by NALT after S. pyogenes infection were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and quantitative RT-PCR.  Wild-type S. pyogenes induces transcription of both type I and IFN-gamma-responsive genes, pro-inflammatory genes, and acute phase response plasma proteins within 24h after infection.   Invasion of NALT and the induction of the interferon response were not dependent on expression of anti-phagocytic M1 protein.  However, infection with an attenuated, less invasive mutant indicated that a robust innate response by NALT is significantly influenced by intra-NALT bacterial load.  Granulocytic populations of NALT, cervical lymph nodes and spleen were discriminated by characteristic surface and intracellular markers.  Intranasal infection induces systemic release of neutrophils and a substantial influx of neutrophils into NALT at 24h, which decline by 48h after infection.  Macrophages do not significantly increase in S. pyogenes-infected NALT.  Intranasal infection of IFN-gamma -/- (GKO) C57BL/6 mice did not lead to systemic dissemination of wild type S. pyogenes, despite reduced expression of IFN-gamma-responsive mRNAs in NALT.   Infected GKO mice had an unregulated influx of neutrophils into NALT compared to immunocompetant mice and mice treated with an anti-IFN-gamma antibody more rapidly cleared S. pyogenes from NALT.  Thus, IFN-gamma-induced responses have a suppressive influence on early clearance of this pathogen from NALT."

Irg1 r is 7 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Results. Eleven of the 12 most highly upregulated mRNAs related to innate immunity and inflammation. They included mRNAs encoding histidine decarboxylase (the enzyme that synthesizes histamine), interleukin (IL)-6, the cell surface receptors PUMA-g and TREM-1, and the polypeptides Irg1 and PROK-2. MSU crystals induced dramatic rises in these mRNAs in the pouch membrane within 3-8 hours after the surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1beta and TNFalpha) and immediate early gene (Egr-1) transcription, which occurred 1h after crystal injection. MSU crystals induced these mRNAs in cultured macrophages with similar kinetics but lower fold changes. In keeping with their downregulation by MSU crystals according to the microarrays, qPCR confirmed that TREM-2 and granzyme D mRNAs decreased 79% and 94%, respectively, in MSU crystal inflamed membranes."

Abcb4 r is 7 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"Background. Abcb4 (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-deficient bile and develop sclerosing cholangitis (SC). The cholangitis involves differential hepatic transcription of genes whose products govern inflammation, activation of hepatic stellate cells and fibrosis.  This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that several genes involved in regulation of tissue inflammation and fibrosis display transcription rates that reflect SC disease activity. Methods. Abcb4 (-/-) mice fed cholic acid (CA) display high SC activity and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) fed mice display low SC activity. Differential hepatic transcription of genes was accordingly measured in abcb4 (-/-) mice maintained on CA- and UDCA-supplemented diets using cDNA microarrays. Abcb4 (+/+) mice served as controls. The differential transcription of selected genes was verified by real time polymerase chain reaction. Liver tissue pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring and immunohistochemistry to visualize bile duct cells and activated hepatic stellate cells. Results. Differential transcription of  Ccl2, Ccl20, Cxcl10, Nfκb1, Nfκb2, Tgfβ1, Tgfβ2, Sparc, Ctgf, Lgals3, Elf3, Spp1, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Col1a1, Col1a2 and Col4a1 genes paralleled the differing SC activities of cholic acid- and UDCA-fed abcb4 (-/-) mice. Histopathology scores and immunohistochemistry showed greatly enhanced activation of hepatic stellate cells during high SC activity due to CA feeding. Conclusion. Differential transcription of several genes relating to tissue inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation parallels SC activity in abcb4 (-/-) mice. Data on their differential transcription may be used to gauge SC disease activity. "

Th2 r is 13 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Upon activation under appropriate costimulatory conditions, naive T helper (Th) cells differentiate into Th2 or Th17 cells, each characterized by the expression of specific effector cytokines. In response to a repeated stimulation with antigen, Th cells develop a stable memory for the expression of those cytokines as well as for other secreted or membrane-associated factors. The stable memory for the expression of proinflammatory effector functions may explain the resistance of Th effector cells to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, and the inability of immunosuppression to cure chronic inflammation. The imprinting of the functional memory is based on epigenetic modifications and expression of distinct transcription factors. In this project, we compare the transcriptomes of once and repeatedly activated murine Th1 cells, to identify genes that induce and maintain the functional memory and control the persistence of pathogenic memory Th1 cells. This in turn might help to discriminate pathogenic versus protective cells in immunopathology and present novel targets for the diagnosis and therapy of chronic inflammatory disease. "

Mecp2 r is 14 
Found silencing in !Series_summary	"Background. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation in women. A great landmark in research in this field was the discovery of a relationship between the disease and the presence of mutations in the gene that codes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Currently, MeCP2 is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor that couples DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. The present study aimed to identify new target genes directly regulated by Mecp2 in a mouse model of RTT. Methodology. We have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) mice in three regions of the brain (cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum) by using cDNA microarrays. The results obtained were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed seven direct target genes of Mecp2 bound in vivo (Dlk1, Mobp, Plagl1, Ddc, Mllt2h, Eya2, and S100a9), and two overexpressed genes due to an indirect effect of a lack of Mecp2 (Irak1 and Prodh). Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the methylation patterns of promoters of the described genes showed no differences between WT and KO mice, demonstrating that methylation differences were not the cause of the observed expression changes. Moreover, the regions bound by Mecp2 were always methylated, suggesting the involvement of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the protein in the mechanism of interaction. Conclusions. We identified new genes that are overexpressed in KO mice and are excellent candidate genes for involvement in various features of the neurodevelopmental disease. Our results demonstrate new targets of MeCP2 and provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of RTT."

Found treated in !Series_summary	"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that preferentially differentiate into mesenchymal cells. If they can be dedifferentiated into embryonic stem cell-like cells, they will be a highly attractive source for cell therapy. Cell and egg extracts have been used in a few studies to evaluate nuclear reprogramming, but these have not examined cell pluripotency in any detail. In this study, we used a cell reversible permeabilization method to treat BMSC with Xenopus laevis mitotic egg extract. We observed an upregulation of the pluripotent protein Oct3/4 in BMSCs treated by this extract. We also further evaluated transcriptional changes with a focused stem cell oligonucleotide array. A number of genes involved in the Notch or Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated in BMSC exposed to Xenopus egg extract. In conclusion, our microarray data from BMSCs exposure to egg extracts may provide interesting clues regarding factors involved in nuclear reprogramming. Our approach is an alternative method towards dedifferentiation of cells without genetic modification, which is preferable in the clinical situation."

MuRF1 r is 3 
Found lacking in !Series_summary	"Muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1) is a muscle-specific protein implicated in the regulation of cardiac myocyte size and contractility. MuRF2, a closely related family member, redundantly interacts with protein substrates, and hetero-dimerizes with MuRF1. Mice lacking either MuRF1 or MuRF2 are phenotypically normal whereas mice lacking both proteins develop a spontaneous cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy indicating cooperative control of muscle mass by MuRF1 and MuRF2. In order to identify the role that MuRF1 plays in regulating cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we created transgenic mice expressing increased amounts of cardiac MuRF1. Adult MuRF1 transgenic (Tg+) hearts exhibited a non-progressive thinning of the left ventricular wall and a concomitant decrease in cardiac function. Experimental induction of cardiac hypertrophy by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) induced rapid failure of MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Microarray analysis identified that the levels of genes associated with metabolism (and in particular mitochondrial processes) were significantly altered in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, both at baseline and during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Surprisingly, ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ mice did not differ from wild type mice despite the depressed contractility following TAC. To explain this discrepancy between the ongoing heart failure and maintained ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, we compared the level and activity of creatine kinase (CK) between wild type and MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Although mCK and CK-M/B protein levels were unaffected in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, total CK activity was significantly inhibited. We conclude that MuRF1’s inhibition of CK activity leads to increased susceptibility to heart failure following TAC, demonstrating for the first time that MuRF1 regulates cardiac energetics in vivo."

Akt1 r is 5 
Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"We explored the mechanistic involvement of the growth arrest and DNA damageinducible gene, GADD45a, in LPS- and ventilator-induced inflammatory lung injury (VILI). Multiple biochemical and genomic parameters of inflammatory lung injury indicated GADD45a-/- mice to be modestly susceptible to intratracheal LPS-induced lung injury and profoundly susceptible to high tidal volume ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) with increases in microvascular permeability and levels of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage. Expression profiling of lung tissues from GADD45a-/- mice revealed strong dysregulation in the B cell receptor signaling pathway suggesting involvement of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling components while the wild type controls depicted no observable changes. Western blot analyses of lung homogenates confirmed ~50% reduction in Akt protein levels in GADD45a-/- mice accompanied by marked increases in Akt ubiquitination. Electrical resistance measurements across human lung endothelial cell monolayers with either reduced GADD45a or Akt expression (siRNAs) revealed significant potentiation of LPS-induced human lung endothelial barrier dysfunction which was attenuated by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 transgene. These studies validate GADD45a as a novel candidate gene in inflammatory lung injury and a significant participant in vascular barrier regulation via effects on Akt-mediated endothelial signaling"

From the list of Dlx3 modulated genes we focused our attention on the study of two candidates, Lifr and Chrdl1.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the recruitment of Dlx3 transcription factor to the promoters of Lifr and Chrdl1, and luciferase assays confirmed the role of Dlx3 in the regulation of Lifr expression.  Over-expression of Dlx3 in mouse embryonic stem cells stimulated Lifr and Chrdl1 expression and inhibited expression of Id proteins and Bmp4.  We show that Dlx3 increases the expression of both soluble and transmembrane forms of Lifr.  Soluble Lifr may regulate extracellular Lif levels via solution binding, while transmembrane Lifr mediates the signal transduction pathway. The data suggests that Dlx3 may be involved in stem cell differentiation in a dosage dependent way through its interaction with Lifr and with Chrdl1, a known antagonist of Bmp4.  We speculate that Dlx3 may also be involved in osteoblast differentiation through interactions involving Lifr, Bmp, and Id proteins and signaling via the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways.  In summary, our data suggests that Dlx3 proteins play a significant role in a highly tuned network in early embryogenesis."

Comparison analyses with the wild type library (GSM 105765) have identified a number of important differentially expressed genes, including genes relevant to noradrenergic neuron differentiation and to the phenotype of NETKO mice. Furthermore we have identified novel differentially expressed genes."

norepinephrine transporter r is 4 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Background: The goal of this study was to determine the transcriptional consequences of norepinephrine transporter (NET) gene deletion in noradrenergic neuron differentiation. The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is the target of powerful mind-altering substances, such as tricyclic antidepressants and the drug of abuse, cocaine. NET function in adult noradrenergic neurons of the peripheral and central nervous systems is that of a scavenger that internalizes norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft. By contrast, norepinephrine (NE) transport has a different role in embryogenesis. It promotes differentiation of neural crest cells and locus ceruleus progenitors into noradrenergic neurons, whereas NET inhibitors, such as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine and the drug of abuse, cocaine, inhibit noradrenergic differentiation. While NET structure und regulation of NET function is well described, little is known about downstream targets of NE transport."

Olig2 r is 7 
Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Origins of the brain tumor, medulloblastoma, from stem cells or restricted pro-genitor cells are unclear. To investigate this, we activated oncogenic Hedgehog signaling in multipotent and lineage-restricted CNS progenitors. We observed that normal unipo-tent cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP) derive from hGFAP+ and Olig2+ rhombic lip progenitors. Hedgehog activation in a spectrum of early and late stage CNS progenitors generated similar medulloblastomas, but not other brain cancers, indicating that acquisition of CGNP identity is essential for tumorigenesis. We show in human and mouse medulloblastoma that cells expressing the glia-associated markers Gfap and Olig2 are neoplastic and that they retain features of embryonic-type granule lineage progenitors. Thus, oncogenic Hedgehog signaling promotes medulloblastoma from lineage-restricted granule cell progenitors."

Found loss in !Series_summary	"Lhx8 is a member of the LIM-homeobox transcription factor family and preferentially expressed in oocytes and germ cells within the mouse ovary. We discovered that Lhx8 knockout females lose oocytes within 7 days after birth. At the time of birth, histological examination shows that Lhx8 deficient (Lhx8(-/-)) ovaries are grossly similar to the newborn wild type ovaries. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries fail to maintain the primordial follicles and the transition from primordial to growing follicles does not occur. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice.

A tetracycline-inducible expression system and microarray analysis showed that a subset of NF-kappa B target genes, including IL-6 and IL-8 are upregulated in LMX1B-expressing HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LMX1B binds to the proximal promoter region of IL-6 and IL-8 in vivo, in the vicinity of the characterized kappa B site, and that LMX1B recruitment correlates with an increased NF-kappa B DNA association. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of p65 impairs LMX1B-dependent induction of NF-kappa B target genes, while activation of NF-kappa B activity by TNF-alpha results in a synergistic induction of these genes by LMX1B. IL-6 promoter-driven reporter assays showed that the kappa B site and an adjacent putative LMX1B binding motif are both involved in LMX1B-mediated transcription. Expression of a number of NF-kappa B target genes is affected in the kidney of Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice, thus supporting the biological relevance of the data obtained in the human cell line. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LMX1B directly regulates transcription of a subset of NF-kappa B target genes in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-kappa B."

This study tested the effect of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on intestinal inflammation using interleukin-10 gene-deficient (Il10-/-) mice. Methods: At 35 days of age, 12 weaned Il10-/- and 12 C57 mice were randomly assigned to one of two modified AIN-76A diets, supplemented with 3.7% purified ethyl esters of either EPA (n-3) or oleic acid (OA, control). To identify genes relevant to colon inflammation, transcription profiling (microarrays and qRT-PCR) and bioinformatic analyses were used. Results: In this study, dietary EPA reversed the decrease in colon fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression observed in OA-fed Il10-/- compared to C57 mice. Il10-/- mice fed the OA diet showed decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, as well as those involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, compared to C57 mice on the same diet. In contrast, dietary EPA increased the expression of these genes in Il10-/- mice. Conclusions: These data indicate that dietary EPA induced endogenous lipid oxidation which might have a potential anti-inflammatory effect on colon tissue. This is supported by the activation of the Ppara gene that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes and proteins."

immediate early r is 7 
Found exposure in !Series_summary	"The growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) promotes the survival and growth of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and stimulates myelopoiesis.  It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  We used kinetic microarray, Northern Blotting and bioinformatics analysis of IL-3 dependent myeloblasts to determine whether IL-3 acts in part by regulating the rate of turnover of mRNA transcripts in specific functional pathways.  Our results indicate that exposure of myeloblasts to IL-3 causes immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function.  Examples include transcripts associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation (pik3cd, myb, pim-1), hematopoietic development (cited2), differentiation control (cdkn1a) and RNA processing (BRF1, BRF2).  A domain in the 3’-utr of IL-6 that mediates IL-3 responsiveness contains AU-rich elements that bind proteins known to modulate mRNA stability, however a known destabilizing protein (AUF1) is shown not to mediate degradation in the absence of IL-3.    These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of this network of transcripts could contribute to growth patterns observed in leukemia."

Found induced in !Series_summary	"Basal (intermediate) progenitors are the major source of neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The molecular machinery governing basal progenitor biogenesis is unknown. Here we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Insm1 (insulinoma-associated 1) is expressed  specifically in progenitors undergoing neurogenic divisions and has a key role in basal progenitor formation. Mouse embryos lacking Insm1 contained half the number of basal progenitors and showed a marked reduction in cortical plate radial thickness. Forced premature expression of Insm1 in neuroepithelial cells resulted in their mitosis occurring at the basal (rather than apical) side of the ventricular zone and induced expression of the basal progenitor marker Tbr2. Remarkably,  these cells remained negative for Tis21, a marker of neurogenic progenitors, and did not generate neurons but underwent self-amplification. Our data imply that Insm1 is involved in the generation  and expansion of basal progenitors, a hallmark of cerebral cortex evolution."

Acquisition of DNA methylation at CpG islands in the ileum of Gpx-1/2-KO mice frequently correlated with loss of H3K27 trimethylation at the same loci. Inflammation-associated DNA methylation occurs preferentially in tissue-specific silent genes and, importantly, is much more frequently represented in tumors than is age-dependent DNA methylation. 60% of aberrant methylation found in tumors is also present in the inflamed tissue.

Found activation in !Series_summary	"The chromatin regulator Aiolos and the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 have been implicated in regulating aspects of B cell maturation and activation. Mice lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development. However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes l5l5 and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly, developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the l5l5 gene is impaired in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of genes involved in pre-BCR function."

The diabetogenic CD4+BDC2.5 (BDC) T cell clone upon transfer into NOD.scid mice induced destruction of islets of Langerhans leading to diabetes. Administration of a neutralizing antibody to IFN-γ (H22) resulted in long term protection (LTP) from diabetes, with inflammation but persistence of a significant, albeit decreased numbers of β-cells. BDC T cells were a mixture of cells expressing high, intermediate and low levels of the T cell receptor. Clonotype-low BDC T cells were required for LTP. Furthermore, islet infiltrating leukocytes in the LTP mice contained Foxp3+CD4 T cells. Islet inflammation in both diabetic and LTP mice was characterized by heavy infiltration of macrophages. Gene expression profiles indicated that macrophages in diabetic mice were M1-type, while LTP mice contained M2-differentiated. The LTP was abolished if mice were treated with either an antibody depleting CD4 T cells, or a neutralizing antibody to CTLA-4, in this case, only at a late stage. Neutralization of IL-10, TGF-β, GITR or CD25 had no effect. Transfer of only clonotype-high expressing BDC T cells induced diabetes but in contrast, H22 antibodies did not inhibit diabetes. While clonotype high T cells induced diabetes even when IFN-γ was neutralized, paradoxically, there was reduced inflammation and no diabetes if host myeloid cells lacked IFN-γ receptor. Hence, using monoclonal CD4 T cells, IFN-γ can have a wide diversity of roles, depending on the setting of the immune process."

Found stimulation in !Series_summary	"The Tec-family kinase Itk plays an important role during T-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like T-cell development. We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found.

Found stimulated in !Series_overall_design	"CD3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from pooled suspensions of spleen and lymph nodes of Wt and Itk knockout mice on C57BL/6 background were isolated after negative depletion. Unstimulated as well as stimulated T-cells were studied. Stimulations were done with anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml) for 24 hrs. For the CD4+ T-cells we collected triplicates from the Itk knockout mice and duplicates from the Wt group. For the CD8+ T-cells, we got duplicates from Itk knockout , while we obtained a single sample from Wt owing to the low cell yield for resting Wt CD8+ T-cells. After CD3-stimulation we got a single sample from the CD8+ subset of both Wt and Itk knockout, while for the CD4+ subsets we collected duplicates."

CD3 r is 1 
Found stimulation in !Series_summary	"The Tec-family kinase Itk plays an important role during T-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like T-cell development. We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found. Taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of Itk."

Tead2 r is 4 
Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"Regulation of organ size is important for development and tissue homeostasis. In  Drosophila, Hippo signaling controls organ size by regulating the activity of a TEAD  transcription factor, Scalloped, through modulation of its coactivator protein Yki. The  role of mammalian Tead proteins in growth regulation, however, remains unknown.  Here we examined the role of mouse Tead proteins in growth regulation. In NIH3T3  cells, cell density and Hippo signaling regulated the activity of Tead proteins by  modulating nuclear localization of a Yki homologue, Yap, and the resulting change in  Tead activity altered cell proliferation. Tead2-VP16 mimicked Yap overexpression,  including increased cell proliferation, reduced cell death, promotion of EMT, lack of cell  contact inhibition, and promotion of tumor formation. Growth promoting activities of  various Yap mutants correlated with their Tead-coactivator activities. Tead2-VP16 and  Yap regulated largely overlapping sets of genes. However, only a few of the Tead/Yapregulated  genes in NIH3T3 cells were affected in Tead1-/-;Tead2-/- or Yap-/- embryos. Most  of the previously identified Yap-regulated genes were not affected in NIH3T3 cells or  mutant mice. In embryos, levels of nuclear Yap and Tead1 varied depending on cell  types. Strong nuclear accumulation of Yap and Tead1 were seen in myocardium,  correlating with requirements of Tead1 for proliferation. However, their distribution did  not always correlate with proliferation. Taken together, mammalian Tead proteins  regulate cell proliferation and contact inhibition as a transcriptional mediator of Hippo  signaling, but the mechanisms by which Tead/Yap regulate cell proliferation differ  depending on cell types, and Tead, Yap and Hippo signaling may play multiple roles in  mouse embryos."

GAP-43 r is 6 
Found lacking in !Series_summary	"Mice lacking the growth associated protein, GAP-43, (KO) show multiple deficits in forebrain axon guidance and cortical cell differentiation (Donovan and McCasland, 2005). As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser  microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis. Expression profiling and functional gene group analysis of RNA from WT, HZ, and KO cortex at postnatal day 5 was performed. We identified thousands of transcripts differentially expressed across the genotypes. Verification of selected changes in gene expression was accomplished using in situ hybridization. Our results suggest an adaptive modification in transcript expression of genes involved in cell-cell communication and synaptogenesis. These modifications appear important in forward and reverse signaling as well as maintaining synchrony between the cells. Compensatory up- and down regulation of synapse-associated genes may explain the reverse in HZ phenotype from P7 to P26. Moreover, these findings provide new insight into the role GAP-43 plays in several pathways associated with synaptogenesis and trans-synaptic signaling."

p53 r is 12 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as high-grade disease that typically harbors EGFR, PTEN and Ink4a/Arf mutations, and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and p53 events1.  Here, we show that concomitant CNS-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with striking clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans.  This genetic observation prompted p53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of p53 as well the expected PTEN mutations.  Integrated transcriptomic profling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives elevated c-Myc levels and its associated signature.  Functional studies validated increased c-Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of p53-Pten null NSCs as well as tumor neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model.  c-Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53-Pten null TNSs. These murine modeling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumor suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish c-Myc as a key target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential."

milk protein r is 10 
Found loss in !Series_summary	"Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in striated and smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine if genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we next studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3 (-/-) null mice. Interestingly, detailed analysis of Cav-3 (-/-) virgin mammary glands shows dramatic increases in ductal thickness, side-branching, and the development of extensive lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Analysis by genome-wide expression profiling reveals the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. The expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc are also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly show that Cav-3 (-/-) mice undergo precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic implantation of a transformed mammary cell line (known as Met-1), we demonstrate that virgin Cav-3 (-/-) mice are dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Interestingly, Cav-3 (+/-) mice also show similar protection, indicating that even reductions in Cav-3 levels are sufficient to render these mice resistant to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cav-3 (-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a constitutive lactogenic microenviroment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic micro-environment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. Most importantly, a lactation-based therapeutic strategy would provide a more natural and nontoxic approach to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies."

Here we show that the transcription factor Gata3 is coexpressed with Cdx2 in the blastocyst and that overexpression of Gata3 in embryonic stem cells is sufficient to induce expression of trophoblast genes. Gata3 expression in the blastocyst does not depend on Cdx2, nor do Gata3 overexpressing cell lines require Cdx2 for expression of a subset of trophoblast genes. In the embryo, expression of Gata3, like Cdx2, depends on Tead4, and expression of both factors becomes restricted to nascent trophoblast by an Oct4-independent mechanism. These observations place Tead4 at the top of a trophoblast hierarchy, with Gata3 and Cdx2 acting downstream to induce expression of common and independent targets in this lineage."

Found treated in !Series_summary	"Cryptorchidism and scrotal heating result in abnormal spermatogenesis but the mechanism(s) proscribing this temperature sensitivity are unknown.  It was previously reported that the AKR/N or MRL/MpJ-+/+ mouse testis is more heat resistant than the testis from the C57BL/6 strain.  We have attempted to probe into the mechanism(s) involved in heat sensitivity by examining global gene expression profiles of normal and heat-treated testes from C57BL/6, AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ mice by microarray analysis.  In the normal C57BL/6 testis, 415 and 416 transcripts were differentially expressed (at least two-fold higher or lower) when compared to the normal AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ testis, respectively.  The AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ strains revealed 268 differentially expressed transcripts between them.  There were 231 transcripts differentially expressed between C57BL/6 and two purported heat-resistant strains, AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+.  Next, the testes of C57BL/6 and AKR/N mice were exposed to 43ºC for 15 min and harvested at different time points for TUNEL studies and microarrays.  An increase of TUNEL-positive germ cell numbers was significant 8 hr after heat exposure in the C57BL/6 mouse.  However, this increase was not observed in the AKR/N mouse until 10 hr after heat exposure.  All tubules showed germ cell loss and disruption in C57BL/6 testis 24 hr after heat shock.  In contrast, although a number of seminiferous tubules showed an abnormal morphology 24 hr post-heat shock in the AKR/N mouse, many tubules still retained a normal structure.  Numerous transcripts exhibited differential regulation between the two strains within 24 hours after heat exposure.  The differentially expressed transcripts in the testes 8 hr after heat exposure were targeted to identify the genes involved in the initial response rather than those due to germ cell loss.  Twenty transcripts were significantly down-regulated and 19 genes were up-regulated by hyperthermia in C57BL/6 and did not show a parallel change in the AKR/N testis.  Conversely, heat shock resulted in 30 up-regulated transcripts and 31 down-regulated transcripts in AKR/N that were not similarly regulated in C57BL/6.  A number of genes shared similar differential expression patterns and differential regulation by hyperthermia in both strains of mice.  Taken together, the present study indicates the diverse genetic backgrounds in the three strains lead to major differences in normal testis gene expression profiles while the differences in heat shock responses involves a significantly smaller number of genes.  The data generated may provide insights regarding gene networks and pathways involved in heat stress and their relationship to spermatogenesis.  "

Furthermore, these cells contribute to mouse chimeras and are germline transmissible. In ES cells, Esrrb targets many genes involved in selfrenewal and pluripotency. This suggests that Esrrb may mediate reprogramming through the up-regulation of ES cell-specific genes.

However, their role in skeletal muscle is not yet fully elucidated and the functional role of each of the LXRα and LXRβ subtypes in skeletal muscle is at present unknown. To study the importance of each of the receptor subtypes, myotube cultures derived from wild type (WT), LXRα and LXRβ knockout (KO) mice were established. The present study shows that treatment with the unselective LXR agonist T0901317 increased mRNA levels of LXR target genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in myotubes established from WT and LXRα KO mice. However, only minor changes in expression level were observed for these genes after treatment with T0901317 in myotubes from LXRβ KO mice. Gene expression analysis using Affymetrix NuGO Genechip arrays showed that few other genes than the classical, well known LXR target genes were regulated by LXR in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, functional studies using radiolabeled substrates showed that treatment with T0901317 increased lipogenesis and apoA1 dependent cholesterol efflux, in myotubes from WT and LXRα KO mice, but not LXRβ KO mice. The data suggest that the lipogenic effects of LXRs, as well as the LXR-stimulated cholesterol efflux, are mainly mediated by LXRβ in skeletal muscle."

Intriguingly, VEGFR2 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis, significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, and markedly reduced adipose metabolism.

We have defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, especially in promoting the enhanced quiescence seen in HSCs that lack the MEF/ELF4 transcription factor. Transcription profiling of HSCs isolated from wild type and p53 null mice identified Gfi-1 and Necdin as p53 target genes and using lentiviral vectors to upregulate or knockdown the expression of these genes, we show their importance in regulating HSC quiescence. Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells."

We show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-C is upregulated in TAFs from resistant tumors. PDGF-C neutralizing antibodies blocked the angiogenesis induced by such TAF in vivo and slowed the growth of EL4 and admixture (TAF-EL4 + TIB6) tumors and exhibited additive effects with anti-VEGF-A antibodies. Hence, our data reveal a novel mechanism for TAF mediated tumorigenesis and suggest that some tumors may overcome inhibition of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis through upregulation of PDGF-C"

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

Inactivation of p56Lck in Treg cells resulted in large-scale changes in their gene expression profile, blocked their capacity to suppress responses, inhibited their proliferation, and caused them to redistribute in the body.  The results make clear multiple aspects of the Treg cell phenotype that are dependent on a sustained capacity to respond through their TCRs."

Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3). The other 18 genes were all involved in different processes. Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10). These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs of the C57Bl/6 aorta at an atherosclerosis-prone location. This is in agreement with findings in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis-prone regions. It could be due to biomechanical differences, for instance in wall tension or shear stress, or the different embryological origin of SMCs in AA and TA."

Furthermore, the transcription profile of the AA was in accordance with a more synthetic SMC phenotype.

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

Here we use a transgenic DS mouse model to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance deregulates chromosomal clusters of genes located near neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) binding sites. We found that DYRK1A binds the SWI/SNF-complex known to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam modifies the transcriptional effect of Dyrk1A-dosage imbalance on L1cam. DyrkA dosage imbalance perturbs Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult neurons. We identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that are responsible for the cellular phenotypic traits present in DS such as dendritic growth impairment and microcephaly during prenatal cortex development. Dyrk1a overexpression in primary mouse cortical neurons reduced the neuritic complexity. In the postnatal hippocampus, DYRK1A overexpression suppresses a form of synaptic plasticity that may be sufficient to cause DS cognitive defects. We propose that DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation generates the brain phenotypic changes that characterize DS, with an accessory role for the gene dosage imbalance of other chromosome 21 genes."

To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"We used gene array analysis of cortical bone to identify Phex-dependent gene transcripts regulating Fgf23 production and mineralization in Hyp mice. We discovered that activation of Fgf receptor- and Wnt-pathways contribute to increased Ffg23 gene transcription in Hyp bone. We found evidence in Hyp bone for increased expression of Fgf1, Fgf7, and Egr2 in the Fgf-signaling pathway and decrements in Sost and Cpz and increments in Sfrp1 and 4 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Fgf and Wnt-signaling stimulated, whereas Tgf β inhibited Fgf23 promoter activity in osteoblasts. We also observed reductions in Bmp1, a metalloproteinase that metabolizes the Fgf23 regulatory extracellular matrix protein Dmp1. These findings suggest that elevation of Fgf23 expression in osteocytes is regulated by interactions between cell surface expression of Phex, extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine effects of Fgf and Wnt. Alterations were also found in enzymes regulating the posttranslational processing and stability of Fgf23, including decrements in the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 and the proprotein convertase Pcsk5. In addition, we found that the Pcsk5 and the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 were decreased in Hyp bone, suggesting that reduced post-translational processing of FGF23 may also contribute to increased Fgf23 levels in Hyp mice. With regards to mineralization, we identified additional candidates to explain the intrinsic mineralization defect in Hyp osteoblasts, including increases in the mineralization inhibitors Mgp and Thbs4, as well as increases in local pH altering factors, carbonic anhydrase 12 (Car12) and 3 (Car3) and the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). These studies demonstrate the complexity of gene expression alterations in bone that accompanies inactivating Phex mutations and identify novel pathways that may coordinate Fgf23 expression and mineralization of extracellular matrix in Hyp bone."

Sca-1 r is 10 
Found lacking in !Series_summary	"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. Upon injury these cells are induced to proliferate in order to quickly re-establish homeostasis. The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFNα), HSCs efficiently exit G0 and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFNα treatment by increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt, expression of IFNα target genes and up-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). HSCs lacking either the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), STAT1 or Sca-1 are insensitive to IFNα stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFNα induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU1, HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFNα and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-FU exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFNα are functionally compromised and are rapidly out competed by non-activatable IFNAR-/- cells in competitive repopulation assays. In summary, while chronic activation of the IFNα pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFNα treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFNα on leukemic cells and raise the possibility for novel applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells. "

Eps8 r is 3 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"In a variety of organisms, including mammals, caloric restriction improves metabolic status and lowers the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, ultimately leading to increased lifespan. Here we show that knockout mice for Eps8, a regulator of actin dynamics, display reduced bodyweight, partial resistance to age- or diet-induced obesity, and overall improved metabolic status. We present evidence that these phenotypes, which are associated to increased lifespan in the Eps8 null mice, are due to caloric restriction. This, in turn, is caused by reduced intestinal fat absorption, due to altered morphogenesis of microvilli in intestinal enterocytes. In the nematode, genetic removal of Eps8, causes a microvillar phenotype, indistinguishable from that observed in mice, which leads to early larval lethality. By exploiting the nematode model system, we demonstrate here that the actin bundling activity of Eps8 is indispensable for viability and proper intestinal morphogenesis. This result links a precise molecular function of Eps8 to proper microvillar morphogenesis, and therefore to the phenotype of Eps8-null mice. Our results implicate actin dynamics in individual variations in bodyweight, metabolic status and longevity."

Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common brain tumors in children.  Some are thought to originate from cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) that fail to undergo normal cell cycle exit and differentiation.  Since microRNAs regulate numerous aspects of cellular physiology and development, we reasoned that alterations in miRNA expression might contribute to MB.  We tested this hypothesis using two spontaneous mouse MB models with specific initiating mutations, Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- and Ink4c-/-; p53-/-.  We found that 26 miRNAs showed increased expression and 24 miRNAs showed decreased expression in proliferating mouse GNPs and MBs relative to mature mouse cerebellum, regardless of genotype.  Among the 26 overexpressed miRNAs, nine were encoded by the miR-17~92 cluster family, a group of microRNAs implicated as oncogenes in several tumor types.  Analysis of human MBs demonstrated that three miR-17~92 cluster miRNAs (miR-92, miR-19a and miR-20) were also overexpressed in human MBs with a constitutively activated SHH signaling pathway, but not in other forms of the disease.  To test whether the miR-17~92 cluster could promote MB formation, we enforced expression of these miRNAs in GNPs isolated from cerebella of postnatal (P) day P6 Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- mice.  These, but not similarly engineered cells from Ink4c-/-; p53-/- mice, formed MBs in orthotopic transplants with complete penetrance.  Interestingly, orthotopic mouse tumors ectopically expressing miR-17~92 lost expression of the wild-type Ptch1 allele.  Our findings suggest a functional collaboration between the miR-17~92 cluster and the SHH signaling pathway in the development of MBs in mouse and man."

Our objective was to understand the molecular mechanisms linking liver regeneration under chronic-inflammation to tumorigenesis. Mdr2-knockout mice, a model of inflammation-associated cancer, underwent partial-hepatectomy which led to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Yet, liver regeneration in these mice was severely attenuated. We demonstrate the activation of the DNA damage response machinery and altered genomic instability during early liver inflammatory stages resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and suggest their involvement in tumor recurrence subsequent to partial hepatectomy. We propose that under the regenerative proliferative stress induced by liver resection, the genomic unstable hepatocytes generated during chronic-inflammation, escape apoptosis and reenter the cell-cycle, triggering the enhanced tumorigenesis"

Pig-a r is 2 
Found knock in !Series_overall_design	"We performed microarray analysis on 3 pools of sorted GPI-deficient (GPI-) and GPI normal (GPI+) bone marrow cells derived from the same Pig-a knock-out animals, and identified 1275/669 genes of the 45,101 transcripts potentially available for screening using 2-fold change, <10% false discovery rate (FDR) and percentage of present calls as selection criteria. The major representative genes belong to the category of immune response. We tested whether the molecular differences between GPI- and GPI+  bone marrow cells could be preserved when GPI- cells were transplanted in lethally-irradiated wild type mice (C57BL/6). Microarray analysis was performed using sorted bone marrow cells from 4 animals transplanted with GPI-deficient bone marrow cells (T-GPI-) from Pig-a knock-out donors, 3 animals transplanted with GPI-normal bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 donors (T-GPI+), and  GPI-normal bone marrow cells from 4  wild-type C57BL/6 mice (WT-GPI+). We found 296 probesets with  2-fold change cutoff, of which T-GPI- cells had 145 up-regulated genes in comparison to WT-GPI+ cells, and had 123 genes differentially expressed when compared to T-GPI+ cells. The gene expression of the GPI-deficient cells was very similar between the two sets of microarray experiments affirming the maintenance of the phenotype before and after bone marrow cell transplantation."

Stat5a r is 2 
Found lacking in !Series_summary	"GM-CSF controls the development of granulocytes but little is known about the contribution of the downstream mediating transcription factor STAT5A/B.  To elucidate this pathway, we generated mice lacking the Stat5a and 5b genes in blood cells.  Peripheral neutrophils were decreased and administration of 5-FU and GM-CSF failed to induce granulopoiesis in Stat5a/b-mutant mice. GMPs were isolated and cultured with GM-CSF.  Both the number and size of STAT5A/B-null colonies were reduced and GM-CSF-induced survival of mature STAT5A/B-null neutrophils was impaired.  Time-lapse cinematography and single cell tracking of GMPs revealed that STAT5A/B-null cells were characterized by a longer generation time and an increased cell death.  Gene expression profiling experiments suggested that STAT5A/B directs GM-CSF signaling through the regulation of cell survival genes."

Clcn1 r is 2 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA dominant disease in which mutant transcripts containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) cause muscle dysfunction by interfering with biogenesis of other mRNAs. The toxic effects of mutant RNA are mediated partly through sequestration of splicing regulator Muscleblind-like 1 (Mbnl1), a protein that binds to CUGexp RNA. A gene that is prominently affected encodes chloride channel 1 (Clcn1), resulting in hyperexcitability of muscle (myotonia). To identify DM1-affected genes and study mechanisms for dysregulation, we performed global mRNA profiling in transgenic mice that express CUGexp RNA, as compared to Mbnl1 knockout and Clcn1 null mice. We found that the majority of changes induced by CUGexp RNA in skeletal muscle can be explained by reduced activity of Mbnl1, including many changes that are secondary to myotonia. The pathway most affected comprises genes involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis. Some effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression are caused by abnormal alternative splicing or downregulation of Mbnl1-interacting mRNAs. However, several of the most highly dysregulated genes showed altered transcription, as indicated by parallel changes of the corresponding premRNAs. These results support the idea that trans-dominant effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression in this transgenic model may occur at the level of transcription, RNA processing, and mRNA decay, and are mediated mainly but not entirely through sequestration of Mbnl1."

To identify DM1-affected genes and study mechanisms for dysregulation, we performed global mRNA profiling in transgenic mice that express CUGexp RNA, as compared to Mbnl1 knockout and Clcn1 null mice. We found that the majority of changes induced by CUGexp RNA in skeletal muscle can be explained by reduced activity of Mbnl1, including many changes that are secondary to myotonia. The pathway most affected comprises genes involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis. Some effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression are caused by abnormal alternative splicing or downregulation of Mbnl1-interacting mRNAs. However, several of the most highly dysregulated genes showed altered transcription, as indicated by parallel changes of the corresponding premRNAs. These results support the idea that trans-dominant effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression in this transgenic model may occur at the level of transcription, RNA processing, and mRNA decay, and are mediated mainly but not entirely through sequestration of Mbnl1."

BH3-only r is 7 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Consistent with defective cytolysis, these cells exhibited deficiencies in granzyme up-regulation. Furthermore, they showed antigen-driven Bcl-2 down-regulation and early up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, consistent with the requirement of this BH3-only protein for peripheral T cell deletion. Bim up-regulation was paralleled by defective IL-7Ra chain re-expression, suggesting that Bim-dependent death may be triggered by loss of IL-7/IL-7R signaling. Finally, we observed parallels in molecular signatures between deletion and anergy suggesting that these tolerance pathways may not be as molecularly distinct as previously surmised."

Found knockout in !Series_summary	"The similarity of transcription profiles among serum-starved fibroblasts of all different WT and ras knockout genotypes tested, indicated that H-Ras and N-Ras do not play significant roles in control of transcriptional responses to serum deprivation stress. In contrast, genomic disruption of H-ras or N-ras, individually or in combination, determined highly specific, differential gene expression profiles in response to post-starvation stimulation with serum for 1 hour (G0/G1 transition) or for 8 hours (mid-G1 progression). The absence of N-Ras caused significantly higher changes than the absence of H-Ras on the wave of transcriptional activation linked to G0/G1 transition. In contrast, the absence of H-Ras affected more potently the profile of the transcriptional wave detected during mid-G1 progression. Functional analysis demonstrated a predominant functional association of H-Ras with growth and proliferation, whereas N-Ras exhibited a closer functional link to development or cell cycle regulation as well as immunomodulation and apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis indicated that ERK-dependent activation of Stat1 mediates the regulatory effect of N-Ras on defense and immunity, whereas the pro-apoptotic effects of N-Ras are mediated through ERK and p38 signaling.  Our observations support previous reports of an absolute requirement for different peaks of Ras activity during the initial stages of the cell cycle and confirm the notion of functional specificity for the H-Ras and N-Ras isoforms."

Rag1 r is 11 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is initiated when natural IgM antibodies recognize neo-epitopes that are revealed on ischemic cells. The target molecules and mechanisms whereby these neo-epitopes become accessible to recognition are not well understood. Proposing that isolated intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may carry IR-related neo-epitopes, we used in vitro IEC binding assays to screen hybridomas created from B cells of unmanipulated wild type C57BL/6 mice. We identified a novel IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb B4) that reacted with the surface of IEC by flow cytometric analysis and was alone capable of causing complement activation, neutrophil recruitment and intestinal injury in otherwise IR-resistant Rag1-/- mice. Monoclonal Ab B4 was found to specifically recognize mouse annexin IV. Pre-injection of recombinant annexin IV blocked IR injury in wild type C57BL/6 mice, demonstrating the requirement for recognition of this protein in order to develop IR injury in the context of a complex natural antibody repertoire. Humans were also found to exhibit IgM natural antibodies that recognize annexin IV. These data in toto identify annexin IV as a key ischemia-related target antigen that is recognized by natural Abs in a pathologic process required in vivo to develop intestinal IR injury."

Tie2 r is 4 
Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Methods: Beginning at 8 weeks of age, male Tie2-GFP mice (transgenically expressing green fluorescent protein exclusively within the endothelia) were fed a 60% fat calorie diet (Bio-Serv #S3282); age-matched mice were fed normal chow. After 4, 6, and 8 weeks on the diet, aortae and skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, and plantaris) were excised, minced, and collagenolytically digested. Each tissue digest was then subjected to FACS in order to obtain 10,000 endothelial cells. Transcriptomic analyses were performed with microarrays containing the Operon Murine V4 oligo set, and highly dysregulated genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. Results: By 4 weeks, Tie2-GFP mice receiving a high fat diet exhibited a fasting glucose of 215+17 mg/dL vs. 134+23 mg/dL in controls; by 6 weeks, a high fat diet resulted in lower glucose tolerance vs. control diet. Following 4, 6, and 8 weeks of high-fat regimen, aortic endothelial transcripts up-regulated by greater than 2-fold in biologically replicate experiments included macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Endothelial transcripts up-regulated in skeletal muscle included Mip2, CCL8 and 9, FLAP, gal-1 and 3, and ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1); transcripts down-regulated in muscle included endothelin-1 (ET-1) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II). Discussion: Gal-3 and FTL-1 are known to increase in response to advanced glycation end-products and oxidized LDL, respectively. However, the down-regulation of ET-1 and IGFII was surprising, as the transcription of these genes has previously been thought to exacerbate atherosclerosis. In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the endothelial transcript-level response to a dietary model of Type II diabetes has revealed novel regulation of transcripts with roles in inflammation, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanism of diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction may lead to improved therapies that lower the risk of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. "

Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Hepatic metabolic derangements are key components in the development of fatty liver, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, is an important regulator of energy homeostasis in response to nutrient availability. Here we demonstrate that hepatic SIRT1 regulates fatty acid metabolism by positively regulating PPAR-alpha. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 impairs PPAR-alpha signaling and decreased fatty acid beta-oxidation in the liver. When challenged with a high-fat diet, liver-specific SIRT1 knockout mice develop hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, our data indicate that SIRT1 plays a vital role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis."

TNF-a r is 1 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Although natural antibodies (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection, and whether they have housekeeping functions. We now show that the prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a previously unknown type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells, and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes. This T15-NAb-mediated process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide “eat me” signals for phagocytic clearance. Further investigation revealed that, the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro macrophage LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, as well as in vitro Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also inhibited in vivo TLR–induced pro-inflammatory responses, and could suppress autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways."
