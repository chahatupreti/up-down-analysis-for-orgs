Found induced in !Series_summary	"We previously observed that formation of aorta and innominate artery atherosclerotic lesions in the intima of hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient mice but not wild-type mice was accompanied by a marked age-dependent adventitial T cell infiltration. As the mice aged, adventitial T cells formed T/T cell-, T/B cell-, and T/B/dendritic cell aggregates adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions. Some of the adventitial infiltrates formed large clusters of various immune cells including T cells, B cells (centrocytes, follicular mantle cells), dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells with preferential formation in the suprarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. These data demonstrated that the immune lineage cell composition of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitia were distinct: The macrophage-foam cell-, T cell-, and SMC-dominated cell composition of atherosclerosis lesions versus the presence of immune cells capable of carrying out antigen-dependent T cell-driven humoral immune responses in the adventitia also indicated that immune reactions carried out in lesions or the adventitia are fundamentaly different. To distinguish between immunity-regulating genes in atherosclerosis lesions versus the adventitia, a combination of microarray profiling and laser capture microdissection was used. Stringent filters revealed 1163 differentially up-regulated probesets in apoE-/- mouse aortae at 78 weeks (w) versus 6 w. A fuzzy c-means cluster algorythm identified 2 clusters that significantly differed in their slope angles between time points: An apparent atherosclerosis cluster consisted of 771 probesets and an apparent adventitia cluster consisted of 392 probesets. Up-regulated genes at 32 w mirrored the influx of monocyte/macrophages into intima lesions whereas genes up-regulated between 32-78 w mirrored adventitial inflammation. To segregate both clusters into separate gene ontology (GO) molecular function groups, we determined statistically significant up-regulation (unpaired Student t-test; p < 0.05) between 6-32 w for the atherosclerosis cluster and between 32-78 w for the adventitia cluster. Among others, GO molecular function terms cytokine activity, cytokine binding, and immunoglobulin binding in the atherosclerosis cluster and cytokine activity, chemokine receptor activity, and antigen binding in the ATLO cluster suggested candidate genes in relation to inflammation triggered by macrophages or adventitia infiltration, respectively. Among other prototype atherosclerosis genes such as Itgax (complement receptor 4), Cd68, Lysz (lysozyme), Vcam1, and Icam1, the atherosclerosis cluster showed markedly overrepresented prototype macrophage/foam cell genes regulating inflammation in cytokine activity (GO: 0005125): Spp1 (osteopontin) and Il6; in cytokine binding (GO: 0019955) Cd74, Il10rb, Ccr2, and Ccr5; and in immunoglobulin binding (GO: 00119865) the proinflammatory galactose-binding lectin Lgals3, as well as genes in scavenger receptor activity and lipid transporter activity. By contrast, the adventitia cluster showed overrepresented genes regulating B cell recruitment, B cell maturation, germinal center formation, and autoimmunity in cytokine activity including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, in CXC chemokine receptor activity the secondary lymphoid organ counterreceptor of CXCL13 Blr1 (also known as Cxcr5), Cxcr3, and Cxcr6; and in antigen binding several histocompatibility-2 loci and various markedly expressed immunoglobulin genes. As embryonic lymph node development and tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis share common features signal intensities of genes specifying the GO molecular function term lymph node development (GO: 0048535) were examined in arrays prepared from wild-type and apoE-/- aortae. These results showed that Id2, Nfkb1, and Ltbr were constitutively expressed at significant levels in aortae of both mouse genotypes whereas other genes including Lta, Ltb, Glycam1, and the two lymphorganogenic genes Cxcl13 and Ccl21 were induced at 78 w in apoE-deficient aortae only. Thus, genes expressed by macrophage-foam cells and genes regulating ATLO neogenesis, embryonic lymph node development, or B cell maturation were constitutively expressed in the arterial wall in both genotypes or emerged in a stepwise fashion at 32 w and 78 w. To verify microarray signal intensity data, separate aortae extracts were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and apoE-deficient mice at 32 and 78 w. These data showed that array signal values accurately reflected gene transcripts. Cell lineage analyses of the adventitial infiltrate and kinetic aorta microarray- and QRT-PCR analyses thus provided circumstantial evidence that immune responses in atherosclerosis intima lesions and the adventitia were distinct. To examine this possibility further, we selected areas of the abdominal aorta burdened with advanced lesions and separated lesions and corresponding adventitial infiltrates of 78 w old apoE-deficient mice by laser dissection microscopy. In addition, adventitiae of aorta segments that were not associated with adjacent lesions and adventitiae of wild-type mice were prepared. Consistent with the lack of a major adventitial leukocyte infiltration, wild-type adventitiae showed gene expression levels that were similar to lesion-free adventitiae of apoE-deficient mice indicating that atherosclerotic lesions directly affected adventitial inflammation in a segmental fashion. Stringent filter criteria identified genes that were differentially expressed in adventitiae and atherosclerotic lesions. Statistical analyses of overrepresented genes in GO molecular function or biological process groups were particularly instructive in cytokine activity, cytokine binding, antigen processing and presentation as well as in lymph node development. Thus, adventitiae in aorta segments with associated atherosclerotic lesions in cytokine activity showed overrepresentation of genes known to be associated with tertiary lymphoid organ formation including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, whereas atherosclerotic lesions showed overrepresentation of prototype atherosclerosis-associated genes Ssp1 (osteopontin), Bmp4 (bone morphogenic protein 4), and Cxc3cl1 (fractalkine); in cytokine binding adventitiae showed overrepresentation of receptors implicated in B cell immunity and autoimmunity including Brl1 (counterreceptor for CXCL13), Ccr7, Tnfrsf4, and Cxcr3 whereas lesions showed overrepresentation of inflammatory mediator receptors including Tnfrs1b, Tgfbr1, and Il7r; moreover, in antigen processing and presentation, adventitiae showed overrepresentation of several histocompatibility loci; additional adventitial gene expression overrepresentations were observed in lymph node development (Fas, SpiB, Ltb, Flt3) whereas lesions showed expression of prototype macrophage genes including Tlr4, Tgfb1, and Tgfb2.  These data provide comprehensive topographical transcriptome information in adventitial tissue adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions versus lesions and are expected to form the basis for future cell lineage expression analyses using single cell detection methodology including ISH."

Mice lacking FcRn accumulated IgG in the GBM as they aged and tracer studies showed delayed clearance of IgG from the kidneys of FcRn deficient mice. Supporting a role for this pathway in disease, saturating the clearance mechanism potentiated the pathogenicity of nephrotoxic sera. These studies support the idea that podocytes play an active role in removing proteins from the GBM and suggest that genetic or acquired impairment of the clearance machinery is likely to be a common mechanism promoting glomerular diseases."

Chronic TNFalpha exposure has been shown to down-modulate T cell responses.  In a mouse T cell hybridoma model, TNFalpha attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.  We have confirmed that chronic TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cells, respectively.  The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness."

We have confirmed that chronic TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cells, respectively.  The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness."

Ahr r is 1 
Found null in !Series_summary	"Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology. In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver. The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner. The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways. p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) is a transcription factor that regulates hyperosmolarity-responsive genes and helps activated T lymphocytes adapt to and discharge their functions in hyperosmolar environments. We report here that the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Brx is essential for increased NFAT5 expression in response to osmotic stress in lymphoid tissues. Indeed, brx haploinsufficient mice expressed significantly less NFAT5 in their spleens than wild type controls and their splenocytes had a defective response to osmotic stress in vitro. Haploinsufficient mice also had smaller-sized spleens containing fewer splenocytes, as well as a defective immunoglobulin response to ovalbumin compared to wild type mice.

Found loss of in !Series_summary	"Emerging evidence implicates transcriptional dyseregulation within skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of Kennedy disease/spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (KD/SBMA). We therefore broadly characterized gene expression in skeletal muscle of three independently generated mouse models of this disorder. The mouse models included a polyglutamine expanded (polyQ) AR knock-in model (AR113Q KI), a polyQ AR transgenic model (AR97Q Tg), and a transgenic mouse which overexpresses wild type AR solely in muscle (HSA-AR Tg). We performed microarray analysis of lower hindlimb muscles taken from these three models using high density oligonucleotide arrays. Changes in gene expression relative to wild type controls were evaluated separately in each strain. We validated our results using quantitative RT-PCR. Patterns of gene expression that are common to all lines and unique to each are described.  When considered globally, the degree of overlap between the three models is approximately equivalent, and several patterns of gene expression relevant to the disease process were observed. Notably, patterns of gene expression typical of loss of AR function were observed in all three models, as were alterations in genes involved in cell adhesion, energy balance, Huntington’s disease, muscle atrophy and myogenesis. By comparing patterns of gene expression in three independent models of KD/SBMA, we have been able to identify candidate genes that might mediate the core myogenic features of KD/SBMA."

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma r is 6 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Rosiglitazone (Rosi), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, activates the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg). This activation causes bone loss in animals and humans, at least in part due to suppression of osteoblast differentiation from marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In order to identify mechanisms by which PPARg2 suppresses osteoblastogenesis and promotes adipogenesis in MSC, we have analyzed the PPARg2 transcriptome in response to Rosi. A total of 4,252 transcriptional changes resulted when Rosi (1 uM) was applied to the U-33 marrow stromal cell line, stably transfected with PPARg2 (U-33/g2), as compared to non-induced U-33/g2 cells. Differences between U-33/g2 and U-33 cells stably transfected with empty vector (U-33/c) comprised 7,928 transcriptional changes, independent of Rosi. Cell type-, time- and treatment-specific gene clustering uncovered distinct patterns of PPARg2 transcriptional control of MSC lineage commitment. The earliest changes accompanying Rosi activation of PPARg2 included adjustments in morphogenesis, Wnt signaling, and immune responses, as well as sustained induction of lipid metabolism. Expression signatures influenced by longer exposure to Rosi provided evidence for distinct mechanisms governing the repression of osteogenesis and stimulation of adipogenesis. Our results suggest interactions that could lead to the identification of a “master” regulatory scheme controlling osteoblast differentiation. "

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Achieving a mechanistic understanding of disease and initiating preclinical therapeutic trials necessitate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems. To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington’s disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects."

A separate population of VEGF-R2+ stem cells expressing the endothelial-specific marker CD144 (VE-cadherin) was also identified at this same time point. Microarray analysis of >45,000 transcripts was performed on RNA obtained from cells expressing VEGF-R2, CD41, and CD144."

Following trauma or disease, the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes is activated, leading to both protective and detrimental effects on CNS recovery. Here we show that transgenic inactivation of astroglial NF-kappaB in mice (GFAP-IkappaBalpha-dn mice) resulted in dramatic reduction of disease severity and improvement in functional recovery following EAE. This coincided with a higher presence of leukocytes in the cord and brain of transgenic mice at the chronic phase of the disease, when the functional recovery over WT mice was the most significant. We observed that expression of proinflammatory genes in both spinal cord and cerebellum was delayed and reduced, while the loss of neuronal-specific molecules essential for synaptic transmission was limited compared to WT mice. Furthermore, death of retinal ganglion cells in affected retinas was almost abolished, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective mechanisms. Our data indicate that inhibiting NF-kappaB in astrocytes results in neuroprotective effects following EAE, directly implicating astrocytes in the pathophysiology of this disease."

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that modify key residues in histones to regulate chromatin architecture, and play a vital role in cell survival, cell cycle progression, and tumorigenesis. To understand the function of Hdac3, a critical component of the N-CoR/SMRT repression complex, a conditional allele of Hdac3 was engineered. Given the vital role of HDAC3 in normal cells and in the generation and treatment of various cancers, a conditional deletion of Hdac3 was engineered in mice. The deletion of Hdac3 in the germ line yielded very early embryonic lethality. Therefore, mouse embryonic-derived fibroblasts (MEFs) containing the Hdac3 conditional allele were used to examine the function of Hdac3 in cell viability and in cell cycle control. Given the links between Hdac3 and transcriptional repression, we used oligonucleotide micro arrays to examine RNA isolated from control and Cre recombinase expressing MEFs to define the changes in gene expression upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Initially, we compared RNA from Ad-Cre infected Hdac3FL/+ and Hdac3FL/- MEFs and then we extended the analysis to Hdac3FL/- MEFs expressing Cre-ER (tamoxifen responsive Cre-estrogen receptor fusion protein).  When the gene expression of ethanol-treated (vehicle) and tamoxifen-treated MEFs was compared at 72 hr post-induction, 83 genes were induced and 111 genes were down-regulated at least 1.5-fold upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Approximately, 48 genes were up-regulated in both Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs at the 72 hr time point.  The majority of the affected genes were associated with signal transduction and metabolism. Overall, few of the up-regulated genes at the 72hr time point in Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs are associated with apoptosis or with cell cycle control. Thus, these metabolic regulatory genes may be “core” Hdac3-regulated genes, and alterations in gene expression are unlikely to trigger apoptosis. "

B lineage cells lacking the related transcription factors IRF-4 and IRF-8 undergo a developmental arrest at the cycling pre-B cell stage and are blocked for light-chain recombination. Using Irf-4,8-/- pre-B cells we demonstrate that two pathways converge to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, a process that is not simply activated by cell cycle exit. One pathway is directly dependent on IRF-4, whose expression is elevated by pre-BCR signaling.  IRF-4 targets the κ 3′ and λ enhancers to increase locus accessibility and positions a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other pathway is triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and results in activation of the κ intronic enhancer via binding of the transcription factor, E2A. Intriguingly, IRF-4 regulates the expression of CXCR4 and promotes the migration of pre-B cells in response to the chemokine CXCL12.

This resulted in the identification of the transmembrane protein 10 (Tmem10/Opalin), a novel type I transmembrane protein enriched in differentiating oligodendrocytes. In primary cultures, Tmem10 was abundantly expressed in O4-positive oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendroglial precursor cells, astrocytes, microglia or neurons. In mature oligodendrocytes Tmem10 was enriched in the rims and processes of the cells and was only found to a lesser extent in the membrane sheets."

leptin r is 1 
Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"Leptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipose tissue, plays a role in both energy homeostasis and reproduction, and is required in early pregnancy.  Leptin stimulates metalloproteinase activity in cultured human trophoblast and stimulates invasiveness of cultured mouse trophoblast.  The goal of the present study was to examine molecular mechanisms of this function in primary cultures of mouse trophoblast.  Leptin was found to stimulate the phosphorylation of MEK, but not STAT3.. It also increased levels of the protein SOCS3.  The ability of leptin to stimulate metalloproteinase activity was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but also by the vehicle inhibitor DMSO.  Microarray analysis revealed that leptin stimulated some genes associated with cell motility, such as Stmn1.  In addition, leptin appeared to inhibit changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast giant cells, including inhibition of members of the TGFß signaling pathway and of genes associated with endoreduplication.  However, feulgen staining revealed a loss of cells with low ploidy.  We conclude that leptin may be promoting trophoblast invasion by maintaining cells in an intermediate stage of differentiation."

Tbx3 r is 1 
Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Methods and Results: We analyzed mice ectopically expressing Tbx3 in the atrial myocardium by genome-wide microarray and expression analysis. We found a prominent role for Tbx3 in defining the nodal phenotype by repressing working myocardial genes (sarcomeric, mitochondrial, fast conduction) and cell proliferation regulators, and in inducing node-associated genes. Moreover, there was a striking induction of genes associated with endocardial cushions and mesenchyme. Using gain-of-function models, we found that in the developing heart both Tbx2 and Tbx3 induce ectopic Bmp2 and Tgfb2 expression and endocardial cushion formation. Analysis of compound Tbx2/Tbx3 mutant embryos revealed that upon loss of more than two functional alleles, expansion of the AV myocardium does not occur and AV cushions fail to form."

Th r is 4 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The catecholamine norepinephrine is required for fetal survival, but its essential function is unknown.  When catecholamine-deficient [tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) null] mouse fetuses die at E13.5-E14.5, they resemble wild type fetuses exposed to hypoxia. They exhibit bradycardia (28% reduction in heart rate), thin ventricular myocardium (20% reduction in tissue), epicardial detachment, and death with vascular congestion, hemorrhage and edema. At E12.5, prior to the appearance of morphological deficits associated with Th deletion, catecholamine-deficient fetuses are preferentially killed by experimentally-induced hypoxia and have lower tissue pO2 than wild type siblings.  Catecholamine-deficient fetuses also induced HIF-1 target genes to a greater extent than wild type siblings, supporting the notion that null fetuses experience greater hypoxia or have an enhanced response to hypoxia. Hypoxia induces a 13-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine levels, which would be expected to increase heart rate, thereby, improving oxygen delivery in wild type mice. Surprisingly, increasing maternal oxygen (FiO2 33% or 63%) prevents the effects of catecholamine-deficiency, restoring heart rate, myocardial mass and survival of Th null fetuses.  We suggest that norepinephrine mediates fetal survival by maintaining oxygen homeostasis as vulnerability to constitutive hypoxia increases as fetal growth accelerates during normal development."

granzyme B r is 3 
Found expressing in !Series_summary	"IL-2 and IL-21 are closely related cytokines that might have arisen by gene duplication. Both cytokines promote the function of effector CD8+ T cells, but their distinct effects on antigen-driven differentiation of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector CD8+ T cells are not clearly understood. We found that antigen-induced expression of eomesodermin and maturation of naïve CD8+ T cells into granzyme B and CD44 expressing effector CD8+ T cells was enhanced by IL-2, but, unexpectedly, suppressed by IL-21. Furthermore, IL-21 repressed expression of IL-2Ra and inhibited IL-2-mediated acquisition of a cytolytic CD8+ T cell phenotype. Despite its inhibitory effects, IL-21 did not induce anergy, but instead potently enhanced the capacity of cells to mediate tumor regression upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, IL-2, surprisingly, impaired the subsequent anti-tumor function of transferred cells. Gene expression studies revealed a distinct IL-21-program that was characterized phenotypically by increased expression of L-selectin and functionally by enhanced anti-tumor immunity that was not reversed by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL-2. Thus, the efficacy of CD8+ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be influenced by opposing differentiation programs conferred by IL-2 and IL-21, a finding with important implications for the development of cellular cancer therapies."

This constitutive, lineage-specific suppression of B cell survival by TRAF2 and TRAF3 determines the requirement for BAFF to sustain B cell development in vivo.  We wished to investigate the effect on gene expression in B cells which lacked the negative regulators TRAF2 and TRAF3, and hence had hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling.

They can be defined as a population adult muscle stem cells based on their self renewal capability and ability to differentiate into skeletal muscle fibers. Functional Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is essential for the process of skeletal muscle differentiation in satellite cell derived primary myoblasts. Furthermore, the biochemical function of pRb is largely associated with its ability to interact with chromatin modifying factors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases thus inhibiting transcription of target gene promoters. Hence, expression profiling of pRb null primary myoblasts and myotubes will provide a global picture of the downstream targets of pRb transcriptional regulation in relation to cell cycle control, apoptosis inhibition, and muscle differentiation."

Found stimulated in !Series_overall_design	"Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was used to induce contractions for 4 hours to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 + 0.1 g/g body weight) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon completion of the study.  An immediate-early growth response was present in the EDL (FOS, JUN, ATF3, MAFK) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus.  Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A, 2B; troponins T3, alpha-tropomyosin, m-creatine kinase) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain slow/1beta, troponin C, tropomyosin 3gamma) in the EDL.  Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration or myofiber damage in stimulated vs. control muscles. Several fiber type specific transcription factors (EYA1, TEAD1, NFATc1 and c4, PPARG, PPARGC1alpha and beta, BHLHB2) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (KLF4, SOX17, TCF15, PKNOX1, ELAV). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or the genes activated during our parallel studies of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (CYCLINS A2, B2, C, E1, MyoD) increased in the stimulated muscles. These data indicated that onset of fast to slow phenotype conversion occurred in the EDL within 4 hours of stimulation without satellite cell recruitment or muscle injury but was driven by phenotype specific transcription factors from resident fiber myonuclei including activation of nascent developmental transcriptional programs."

Trp63 r is 1 
Found knockdown in !Series_summary	"Genome-wide identification of bona fide targets of transcription factors in mammalian cells is still a challenge. We present a novel integrated computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets of a transcription factor. This consists in measuring time-course (dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription factor under study, and in applying a novel reverse-engineering” algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system, we identified novel transcriptional target genes of Trp63, a crucial regulator of skin development. TSNI-predicted Trp63 target genes were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify Trp63-bound regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene expression in mammalian cells. We show that Trp63 transiently regulates a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by Trp63, through direct regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental and computational approach described here is readily applicable to other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary to genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites."

HL r is 1 
Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive arrhythmia for which current therapy is inadequate. During AF, rapid stimulation causes atrial remodeling that promotes further AF. The cellular signals that trigger this process remain poorly understood, however, and elucidation of these factors would likely identify new therapeutic targets. We have previously shown that immortalized mouse atrial (HL-1) myocytes subjected to 24 hr of rapid stimulation in culture undergo remodeling similar to that seen in animal models of atrial tachycardia (AT) and human AF. This preparation is devoid of confounding in vivo variables that can modulate gene expression (e.g., hemodynamics). Therefore, we investigated the transcriptional profile associated with early atrial cell remodeling. RNA was harvested from HL-1 cells cultured for 24 hr in the absence and presence of rapid stimulation and subjected to microarray analysis. Data were normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA), and genes exhibiting significant differential expression were identified using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method. Using this approach, 919 genes were identified that were significantly altered with rapid stimulation (763 up-regulated and 156 down-regulated). For many individual transcripts, changes typical of AF/AT were observed, with marked up-regulation of genes encoding BNP and ANP precursors, heat shock proteins, and MAP kinases, while novel signaling pathways and molecules were also identified. Both stress and survival response were evident, as well as up-regulation of multiple transcription factors. Genes were also functionally classified based on cellular component, biologic process, and molecular function using the Gene Ontology database to permit direct comparison of our data with other gene sets regulated in human AF and experimental AT. For broad categories of genes grouped by functional classification, there was striking conservation between rapidly stimulated HL-1 cells and AF/AT. Results were confirmed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 13 genes selected by physiological relevance in AF/AT and regulation in the microarray analysis (up, down, and nonregulated). Rapidly-stimulated atrial myocytes provide a complementary experimental paradigm to explore the initial cellular signals in AT remodeling to identify novel targets in the treatment of AF."

The cellular signals that trigger this process remain poorly understood, however, and elucidation of these factors would likely identify new therapeutic targets. We have previously shown that immortalized mouse atrial (HL-1) myocytes subjected to 24 hr of rapid stimulation in culture undergo remodeling similar to that seen in animal models of atrial tachycardia (AT) and human AF. This preparation is devoid of confounding in vivo variables that can modulate gene expression (e.g., hemodynamics). Therefore, we investigated the transcriptional profile associated with early atrial cell remodeling. RNA was harvested from HL-1 cells cultured for 24 hr in the absence and presence of rapid stimulation and subjected to microarray analysis. Data were normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA), and genes exhibiting significant differential expression were identified using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method. Using this approach, 919 genes were identified that were significantly altered with rapid stimulation (763 up-regulated and 156 down-regulated). For many individual transcripts, changes typical of AF/AT were observed, with marked up-regulation of genes encoding BNP and ANP precursors, heat shock proteins, and MAP kinases, while novel signaling pathways and molecules were also identified. Both stress and survival response were evident, as well as up-regulation of multiple transcription factors. Genes were also functionally classified based on cellular component, biologic process, and molecular function using the Gene Ontology database to permit direct comparison of our data with other gene sets regulated in human AF and experimental AT. For broad categories of genes grouped by functional classification, there was striking conservation between rapidly stimulated HL-1 cells and AF/AT. Results were confirmed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 13 genes selected by physiological relevance in AF/AT and regulation in the microarray analysis (up, down, and nonregulated). Rapidly-stimulated atrial myocytes provide a complementary experimental paradigm to explore the initial cellular signals in AT remodeling to identify novel targets in the treatment of AF."

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"The reduced folate carrier (RFC1) is an integral membrane protein and facilitative anion exchanger that mediates delivery of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into mammalian cells.  Adequate maternal-fetal transport of folate is necessary for normal embryogenesis.  Targeted inactivation of the murine RFC1 gene results in post-implantation embryo lethality, but daily folic acid supplementation of pregnant dams prolongs survival of homozygous embryos until mid-gestation.  At E10.5 RFC1-/- embryos are developmentally delayed relative to wildtype littermates, have multiple malformations, including neural tube defects, and die due to failure of chorioallantoic fusion.  The mesoderm is sparse and disorganized, and there is a marked absence of erythrocytes in yolk sac blood islands.  Affymetrix microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR validation of the relative gene expression profiles in E9.5 RFC1-/- vs. RFC1+/+ embryos indicates a dramatic downregulation of multiple genes involved in erythropoiesis, and upregulation of several genes that form the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex.  Megalin protein expression disappears from the visceral yolk sac of RFC1-/- embryos, and cubilin protein is widely misexpressed.  Inactivation of RFC1 impacts the expression of several ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-amnionless-megalin complex that are involved in the maternal-fetal transport of folate, vitamin B12, and other nutrients, lipids and morphogens required for normal embryogenesis."

Mdr1a-/- mice spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation, predominantly in the colon, with pathology similar to IBD, so this mouse model is relevant for studying diet-gene interactions and potential effects of foods on remission or development of IBD. This study tested whether the addition of curcumin or rutin to the diet would alleviate colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Using whole-genome microarrays, the effect of dietary curcumin on gene expression in colon tissue was also investigated. Twelve mice were randomly assigned to each of three diets; control (AIN-76A), control + 0.2% curcumin or control + 0.1% rutin and monitored from the age of 7 to 24 weeks. Curcumin, but not rutin, significantly reduced histological signs of colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Microarray and pathway analyses suggested that the effect of dietary curcumin on colon inflammation could be via an up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways probably mediated by PXR and PPARalpha activation of RXR. These results reveal the potential of global gene expression and pathway analyses to study and better understand the effect of foods in colonic inflammation."

We studied here the sequence of events leading to thyroid cancer in Tg-RP3 and Tg-E7 mice expressing the transgene exclusively in the thyroid under the control of thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter. Both transgenic mice develop thyroid hyperplasia followed by solid differentiated carcinoma in older animals. To understand the different steps leading to carcinoma, we analyzed thyroid gene expression in both strains at different ages (2, 6, 10 months) by microarray technology. Important biological processes were differentially regulated in the two tumor types. In E7 thyroids cell cycle was the most upregulated process; observation consistent with the huge size of these tumors. In RP3 thyroids immunity was the most significantly regulated process, as previously observed in microarray data on human PTC. Interestingly, other human PTC characteristics were also observed in RP3 but not in E7 mouse tumors: similar regulation of several human PTC markers, upregulation of many EGF-like growth factors and finally significant regulation of angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling-related genes.

This study characterizes the global transcriptional response of mouse liver to a symptomatic dose (0.26 ng/g) of the highly potent Pacific ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1).  At 1 h post exposure 2.4% of features on a 44K whole genome array were differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.0001), increasing to 5.2% at 4 h and decreasing to 1.4% by 24 h post-CTX exposure.  Early gene expression was likely influenced prominently by an acute 4 °C decline in core body temperature by 1 h, which resolved by 8 h following exposure.  Cytochrome P450s were of particular interest due to their role in xenobiotic metabolism.  Twenty-seven genes, mostly members of Cyp2 and Cyp4 families, showed significant changes in expression.  Many Cyps underwent an initial down-regulation at 1 h but were quickly and strongly up-regulated at 4 and 24 h post exposure.  In addition to Cyps, increases in several glutathione S-transferases were observed, an indication that both phase I and phase II metabolic reactions are involved in the hepatic response to CTX in mice."

leukemia inhibitory factor r is 7 
Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"During development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are generated from common neural precursor cells (NPCs). However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor STAT3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development."

Inactivation of the Mll5 gene in mice results in reduced cellularity of the long-term HSC compartment, which correlates with functional impairment of long-term repopulation potential under competitive conditions.  Bone marrow cells from Mll5-deficient mice were defective in spleen colony-forming assays, and the mutant mice showed enhanced susceptibility to 5-Fluorouracil-induced myelosuppression.  Heterozygous and homozygous Mll5 mutant mice did not spontaneously develop hematologic cancers, and loss of Mll5 did not alter the phenotype of a fatal myeloprolferative disorder induced by oncogenic Kras in vivo.

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CBP/p300 in the activation of ß-catenin/TCF target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the TCF/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling revealed that FHL2 deficiency triggers a broad change of the cell cycle program that is associated with downregulation of several G1/S and G2/M cyclins, E2F transcription factors and DNA replication machinery, thus correlating with reduced cell proliferation. This change also involves downregulation of the negative cell cycle regulators, particularly INK4 inhibitors, which could counteract the decreased expression of cyclins, allowing cells to grow. Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."

Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."

CBP/p300 r is 3 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CBP/p300 in the activation of ß-catenin/TCF target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the TCF/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts.

Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"Pneumocystis is a pathogen of immunocompromised hosts but can also infect healthy hosts, in whom infection is rapidly controlled and cleared. To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of  C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes.  Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks.   In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40 ligand is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia."

Found knockout in !Series_summary	"Rationale: While modulation of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) has shown to be a risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension for almost 40 years, there is a lack of in vivo data about the broad molecular effects of pulmonary inhibition of 5HTT. Previous studies have suggested effects on inflammation, proliferation, and vasoconstriction. The goal of this study was to determine which of these were supported by alterations in gene expression in serotonin transporter knockout mice. Methods: Eight week old normoxic mice with a 5-HTT knock-out (5HTT-/-) and their heterozygote(5HTT+/-) or wild-type(5HTT+/+) littermates had right ventricular systolic pressure(RVSP) assessed, lungs collected for RNA, pooled, and used in duplicate in Affymetrix array analysis. Representative genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Results: RVSP was normal in all groups. Only 124 genes were reliably changed between 5HTT-/- and 5HTT+/+ mice. More than half of these were either involved in inflammatory response or muscle function and organization; in addition, some matrix, heme oxygenase, developmental, and energy metabolism genes showed altered expression. Quantitative RT-PCR for examples from each major group confirmed changes seen by array, with an intermediate level in 5HTT+/- mice. Conclusions: These results for the first time show the in vivo effects of 5HTT knockout in lungs, and show that many of the downstream mechanisms suggested by cell culture and ex vivo experiments are also operational in vivo.  This suggests that the effect of 5HTT on pulmonary vascular function arises from its impact on several systems, including vasoreactivity, proliferation, and immune function."

Additional analyses presented here yield novel insights into the genes and processes involved in papilloma development in Tg.AC mice."

titin r is 5 
Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Titin is a striated muscle-specific giant elastic protein and largely responsible for the generation of the diastolic force in the cardiac myocyte. Cardiac titin undergoes developmental changes in isoform expression during the course of cardiac development. At present, at least five size classes of titin isoforms (N2B and N2BA-A1, A2, N1, N2) have been identified using SDS agarose gel electrophoresis. The larger titin isoform N2BAs gradually decreased with ages, in contrast, the smaller titin isoform N2B increased in normal cardiomyocyte, and cardiac myocytes containing a higher proportion of the smaller titin isoform N2B have stronger passive tension than that with a lower proportion of the larger titin isoform N2BAs. Recently we found an autosomal dominant mutation which caused totally opposite cardiac titin isoform expression as compared to developmental stages. The larger total titin isoform N2BA increased in mutant rat cardiac myocytes with ages instead of the smaller cardiac titin isoform N2B. For the moment, mechanism of titin isoform switch is still unknown, therefore, the mutant rats will give us nevol sight to elucidate the titin splicing mechanism."

Htt r is 4 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (Htt) protein is a cause of Huntington’s disease (HD).  Htt is an essential gene as  deletion of the mouse Htt gene homolog (Hdh) is embryonic lethal in mice. Therefore, in addition to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for polyQ-mediated pathology, it is also important to understand the normal function of Htt protein for both basic biology and for HD. To systematically search for a mouse Htt function, we took advantage of the Hdh +/- and Hdh-floxed mice and generated four mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lines which contain a single copy of the Hdh gene (Hdh-HET) and four MEF lines in which the Hdh gene was deleted (Hdh-KO).   The function of Htt in calcium (Ca2+) signaling was analyzed in Ca2+ imaging experiments with generated cell lines.   We found that the cytoplasmic Ca2+ spikes resulting from the activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and the ensuing mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were suppressed in the Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  Furthermore,  in experiments with permeabilized cells we found that the InsP3-sensitivity of Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum was reduced in Hdh-KO cells.  These results indicated that Htt plays an important role in modulating InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling.  To further evaluate function of Htt, we performed genome-wide transcription profiling of generated  Hdh-HET and Hdh-KO cells by microarray.  Our results revealed that 106 unique transcripts were downregulated by more than two-fold with p < 0.05 and 173 unique transcripts were upregulated at least two-fold with p < 0.05 in Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  The microarray results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for a number of affected transcripts.  Several signaling pathways affected by Hdh gene deletion were identified from annotation of the microarray results.   The unbiased approach used in our study provides novel and unique information about the normal function of Htt in cells, which may contribute to our understanding and treatment of HD."

Our results revealed that 106 unique transcripts were downregulated by more than two-fold with p < 0.05 and 173 unique transcripts were upregulated at least two-fold with p < 0.05 in Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  The microarray results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for a number of affected transcripts.  Several signaling pathways affected by Hdh gene deletion were identified from annotation of the microarray results.

Found KO in !Series_summary	"The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (Htt) protein is a cause of Huntington’s disease (HD).  Htt is an essential gene as  deletion of the mouse Htt gene homolog (Hdh) is embryonic lethal in mice. Therefore, in addition to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for polyQ-mediated pathology, it is also important to understand the normal function of Htt protein for both basic biology and for HD. To systematically search for a mouse Htt function, we took advantage of the Hdh +/- and Hdh-floxed mice and generated four mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lines which contain a single copy of the Hdh gene (Hdh-HET) and four MEF lines in which the Hdh gene was deleted (Hdh-KO).   The function of Htt in calcium (Ca2+) signaling was analyzed in Ca2+ imaging experiments with generated cell lines.   We found that the cytoplasmic Ca2+ spikes resulting from the activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and the ensuing mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were suppressed in the Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  Furthermore,  in experiments with permeabilized cells we found that the InsP3-sensitivity of Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum was reduced in Hdh-KO cells.

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"The lack of axonal growth after injury in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is partly due to the presence of growth-inhibitory molecules associated with myelin and the intrinsic growth-state of the injured neurons. To date, three inhibitors have been identified in myelin: Myelin- Associated Glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo A, and Oligodendrocyte-Myelin glycoprotein (OMgp). These three proteins all appear to be located in the periaxonal surface of the myelin membrane placing them in an optimal location to mediate axon-glial interaction.  In addition, the three proteins have been shown to bind the same neuronal receptor, known as the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR).  It has been hypothesized that inhibition of NgR may be a strategy to increase regeneration, plasticity and functional recovery of the lesioned central nervous system. Strong NgR mRNA expression is observed in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layers (CA1-3) and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus.  It has been shown that animals exposed to entorhinal lesions show a biphasic regulation of NgR in the hippocampus, suggesting a tightly regulated mechanism mediated by this receptor.  We have access to a transgenic model to over-express NgR in forebrain hippocampal neurons. Preliminary results have shown a phenotypic response in behavior and some molecular markers, as result of NgR overexpression.  Knowledge of what genes are reacting in this novel transgenic model may provide insights into what pathways are affected by NgR to control synaptic plasticity in normal animals and during injury."

This expansion of BASCs is the result of a dramatic increase in canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelium upon loss of Gata6. Expression of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Fzd2 is down-regulated in Gata6 mutants and increased Fzd2 or decreased β-catenin expression rescues, in part, the lung epithelial defects in Gata6 mutants.  During lung epithelial regeneration, we show that canonical Wnt signaling is activated in the niche containing BASCs and forced activation of Wnt signaling leads to a dramatic increase in BASC numbers.  Moreover, Gata6 is required for proper lung epithelial regeneration and postnatal loss of Gata6 leads to increased BASC expansion and decreased differentiation.  Together, these data demonstrate that Gata6 regulated Wnt signaling controls the balance between stem/progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation required for both lung development and regeneration."

Fbw7-/- HSCs show defective maintenance of quiescence, leading to impaired self-renewal and a severe loss of competitive repopulating capacity. Furthermore, Fbw7-/- HSC  are unable to colonize the thymus leading to a profound depletion of T cell progenitors. Deletion of Fbw7 in bone marrow stem cells and progenitors leads to the stabilization of c-Myc, a transcription factor previously implicated in HSC self-renewal. On the other hand, neither Notch1 nor cyclin E are stabilized in the bone marrow of Fbw7 deficient mice. Genome-wide transcriptome studies of Fbw7-/- HSC and hematopoietic progenitors indicate that Fbw7 controls, through the regulation of HSC cell cycle entry, the global transcriptional “signature” that is associated with the quiescent, self-renewing HSC phenotype."

Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor auto-up-regulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of BIM expression. Additionally, cotreatment with glucocorticoids induced Ccnd2 upregulation in the gut which protected mice from the intestinal secretory metaplasia typically induced by loss of NOTCH signaling.

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

Despite attenuation of DyopH in vivo, by variation of infection doses we were able to achieve conditions that allow comparison of gene expression in pYV+ and DyopH infections at either comparable infection courses or splenic bacterial burden. Gene expression analysis provided evidence that expression levels of several immune response genes including IFN-g and IL-6 are high after pYV+ infection but low after sublethal DyopH infection. In line with these findings,  infection of IFN-gR-/- and IL-6-/- mice with pYV+ or DyopH revealed that these cytokines are dispensable for control of DyopH, but not pYV+ infection. Consistently, in bacteria killing assays with BMM in vitro, stimulation of BMM with IFN-g is required for killing of pYV+ but not DyopH."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"CpG DNA interacts with TLR9 to stimulate a broadly protective innate immune response. This study uses bioinformatic network analysis of microarray data to identify the genes and regulatory networks triggered by CpG ODN. CpG treatment induced significant gene up-regulation (p < 0.00001) in the spleen within 30 min, peaking with the activation of >500 genes at 3 hr, and declining progressively thereafter. There were reproducible changes in the pattern of gene expression over time. This was mediated by a small group of “major inducers” (IL1A, IL1B, TNF, IFNG) whose activity was modulated by several “minor inducers” (NFKB1, IL6, IL15, IL18, STAT1, STAT2). The subsequent decline in gene activation was mediated by “suppressors” (MYC, IL1RN, SOCS1, SOCS3, NFKBIA, IL10, FOS) that actively down-regulated gene expression and targeted both major and minor inducers. Thus, the regulation of TLR9 dependent gene activation involves multiple waves of stimulation mediated by a small number of “major” and “minor” inducers followed by the active inhibition of gene expression by “suppressors”."

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"Background: Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention known to extend lifespan in a wide range of organisms, including mammals. However, the mechanisms by which it regulates mammalian aging remain largely unknown and the involvement of the TOR and Sirtuin pathways (which regulate aging in lower organisms) remain controversial. Femaleness is a second phenotype generally associated with longevity but the relationship between sex-biased and CR-induced gene expression remains undetermined.    Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated microarray gene expression data from livers of male mice fed high calorie or CR diets, and we find that CR significantly changes the expression of over 3,000 genes, many between 10- and 50-fold. We compare our data to the GenAge database of known aging-related genes and to prior microarray expression data of genes expressed differently between male and female mice. CR generally feminizes gene expression and many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging, hormone signaling, and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Among the genes showing the largest and most statistically significant CR-induced expression differences are Ddit4, a key regulator of the TOR pathway, and Nnmt, a regulator of lifespan linked to the Sirtuin pathway. Using Western analyses, we confirmed post-translational inhibition of the TOR pathway.    Conclusions: Our data show that CR induces widespread gene expression changes and acts through highly evolutionarily conserved pathways, from microorganisms to mammals, and that its life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of the longer-lived female sex."

Among the genes showing the largest and most statistically significant CR-induced expression differences are Ddit4, a key regulator of the TOR pathway, and Nnmt, a regulator of lifespan linked to the Sirtuin pathway. Using Western analyses, we confirmed post-translational inhibition of the TOR pathway.    Conclusions: Our data show that CR induces widespread gene expression changes and acts through highly evolutionarily conserved pathways, from microorganisms to mammals, and that its life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of the longer-lived female sex."

We have also identified the Dkk1 gene, encoding a secreted inhibitor of canonical β-catenin signaling as a target of GATA4/FOG2 repression in the developing ovary. The tissue-specific ablation of the β-catenin gene in the gonads disrupts female development while in the Gata4ki/ki/Dkk1-/- or Fog2-/-/Dkk1-/- embryos the normal ovarian gene expression pattern is partially restored. Control of ovarian development by the GATA4/FOG2 complex presents a novel insight into the crosstalk of transcriptional regulation and extracellular signaling in ovarian development."

progesterone receptor r is 3 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The lymphatic system is a common avenue for the spread of breast cancer cells and dissemination through it occurs at least as frequently as hematogenous metastasis. Approximately 75% of primary breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and the majority of these maintain receptor expression as lymph node (LN) metastases. However, it is unknown if ER function is equivalent in cancer cells growing in the breast and in the LNs. We have developed a model to assess estrogen responsiveness in ER(+) breast tumors and LN metastases. Fluorescent ER(+) MCF-7 tumors were grown in ovariectomized nude mice supplemented with estradiol. Once axillary LN metastasis arose, estradiol was withdrawn (EWD), for 1 or 4 weeks, or continued, to assess estradiol responsiveness. On EWD, proliferation rates fell similarly in tumors and LN metastases. However, estradiol-dependent ER down-regulation and progesterone receptor induction were deficient in LN metastases, indicating that ER-dependent transcriptional function was altered in the LN. Cancer cells from estradiol-treated and EWD primary tumors and matched LN metastases were isolated by laser capture microdissection. Global gene expression profiling identified transcripts that were regulated by the tissue microenvironment, by hormones, or by both. Interestingly, numerous genes that were estradiol regulated in tumors lost estradiol sensitivity or were regulated in the opposite direction by estradiol in LN metastases. We propose that the LN microenvironment alters estradiol signaling and may contribute to local antiestrogen resistance."

Found knockout in !Series_summary	"XBP1 is a transcription factor that is induced by unconventional splicing associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays a role in development of liver and plasma cells. We previously reported that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) leads to splicing of XBP1 mRNA in neurites, and that XBP1 is required for BDNF-induced neurite extension and branching. To search for the molecular mechanisms of how XBP1 plays a role in neural development, comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed in primary telencephalic neurons obtained from Xbp1 knockout mice at embryonic day 12.5. By searching for the genes induced by BDNF in wild type neurons but this induction was reduced in Xbp1 knockout mice, we found that upregulation of three GABAergic markers, somatostatin (Sst), neuropeptide Y (Npy), and calbindin (Calb1), were compromised in Xbp1 knockout neurons. Attenuated induction of Npy and Calb1 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. In neurons lacking in Xbp1, upregulation of GABAergic markers was attenuated.  Impaired BDNF-induced neurite extension in Xbp1 knockout neurons might be mediated by disturbed BDNF-induced differentiation of GABAergic interneurons."

Found loss of in !Series_summary	"Radiotherapy is widely used to treat human cancer. Patients locally recurring after radiotherapy, however, have increased risk of metastatic progression and poor prognosis. The clinical management of post-radiation recurrences remains an unresolved issue. Tumors growing in pre-irradiated tissues have an increased fraction of hypoxic cells and are more metastatic, a condition known as tumor bed effect. Here we demonstrate that tumor cells growing in a pre-irradiated bed, or selected in vitro though repeated cycles of severe hypoxia, retain an invasive and metastatic capacities when returned to normoxia. HIF activity, while it facilitates metastatic spreading of tumors growing in a pre-irradiated bed, is not essential. Through gene expression profiling and gain and loss of function experiments, we identified the matricellular protein CYR61 and aVb5 integrin, as proteins cooperating to mediate these effects. Inhibition of aVb5 integrin suppressed invasion and metastasis induced by CYR61 and attenuated metastasis of tumors growing within a pre-irradiated field. These results represent a conceptual advance to the understanding of the tumor bed effect and identify CYR61 and aVb5 integrin as proteins that co-operate to mediate metastasis. They also indicate aV integrin inhibition a potential therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis in patients at risk for post-radiation recurrences, which can be promptly tested in the clinic."

S. pyogenes can persist in tonsils, while one-third of children treated with antibiotics continue to shed streptococci and have recurrent infections. Mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) is functionally analogous to human oropharangeal lymphoid tissues. The innate immune responses of naïve cells from a mucosal site to S. pyogenes is not well described; therefore, we infected C57BL/6 mice intranasally with 108 CFU S. pyogenes. Transcriptional responses by NALT after S. pyogenes infection were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and quantitative RT-PCR.  Wild-type S. pyogenes induces transcription of both type I and IFN-gamma-responsive genes, pro-inflammatory genes, and acute phase response plasma proteins within 24h after infection.   Invasion of NALT and the induction of the interferon response were not dependent on expression of anti-phagocytic M1 protein.  However, infection with an attenuated, less invasive mutant indicated that a robust innate response by NALT is significantly influenced by intra-NALT bacterial load.  Granulocytic populations of NALT, cervical lymph nodes and spleen were discriminated by characteristic surface and intracellular markers.  Intranasal infection induces systemic release of neutrophils and a substantial influx of neutrophils into NALT at 24h, which decline by 48h after infection.  Macrophages do not significantly increase in S. pyogenes-infected NALT.  Intranasal infection of IFN-gamma -/- (GKO) C57BL/6 mice did not lead to systemic dissemination of wild type S. pyogenes, despite reduced expression of IFN-gamma-responsive mRNAs in NALT.   Infected GKO mice had an unregulated influx of neutrophils into NALT compared to immunocompetant mice and mice treated with an anti-IFN-gamma antibody more rapidly cleared S. pyogenes from NALT.

Abcb4 (-/-) mice fed cholic acid (CA) display high SC activity and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) fed mice display low SC activity. Differential hepatic transcription of genes was accordingly measured in abcb4 (-/-) mice maintained on CA- and UDCA-supplemented diets using cDNA microarrays. Abcb4 (+/+) mice served as controls. The differential transcription of selected genes was verified by real time polymerase chain reaction. Liver tissue pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring and immunohistochemistry to visualize bile duct cells and activated hepatic stellate cells. Results.

The stable memory for the expression of proinflammatory effector functions may explain the resistance of Th effector cells to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, and the inability of immunosuppression to cure chronic inflammation. The imprinting of the functional memory is based on epigenetic modifications and expression of distinct transcription factors. In this project, we compare the transcriptomes of once and repeatedly activated murine Th1 cells, to identify genes that induce and maintain the functional memory and control the persistence of pathogenic memory Th1 cells. This in turn might help to discriminate pathogenic versus protective cells in immunopathology and present novel targets for the diagnosis and therapy of chronic inflammatory disease. "

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"Transcription initiation in mammals is assumed to be independently controlled among nearby genes. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. A simple question therefore arises: is it possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous neighboring transcripts? Here we show that intensive transcription of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulation is often accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighboring genes. Profiling primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation of transcription centered on IEGs. Even in surrounding intergenic regions, which lack annotated protein-coding genes, transcriptional upregulation took place at the same time. We further found that acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG induction and neighbouring co-upregulation, and that inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all these transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional activation has a ripple effect, and causes a substantial fluctuation in multiple intragenic and intergenic transcripts."

A great landmark in research in this field was the discovery of a relationship between the disease and the presence of mutations in the gene that codes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Currently, MeCP2 is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor that couples DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. The present study aimed to identify new target genes directly regulated by Mecp2 in a mouse model of RTT. Methodology. We have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) mice in three regions of the brain (cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum) by using cDNA microarrays. The results obtained were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed seven direct target genes of Mecp2 bound in vivo (Dlk1, Mobp, Plagl1, Ddc, Mllt2h, Eya2, and S100a9), and two overexpressed genes due to an indirect effect of a lack of Mecp2 (Irak1 and Prodh). Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the methylation patterns of promoters of the described genes showed no differences between WT and KO mice, demonstrating that methylation differences were not the cause of the observed expression changes. Moreover, the regions bound by Mecp2 were always methylated, suggesting the involvement of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the protein in the mechanism of interaction. Conclusions. We identified new genes that are overexpressed in KO mice and are excellent candidate genes for involvement in various features of the neurodevelopmental disease. Our results demonstrate new targets of MeCP2 and provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of RTT."

In this study, we used a cell reversible permeabilization method to treat BMSC with Xenopus laevis mitotic egg extract. We observed an upregulation of the pluripotent protein Oct3/4 in BMSCs treated by this extract. We also further evaluated transcriptional changes with a focused stem cell oligonucleotide array. A number of genes involved in the Notch or Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated in BMSC exposed to Xenopus egg extract. In conclusion, our microarray data from BMSCs exposure to egg extracts may provide interesting clues regarding factors involved in nuclear reprogramming. Our approach is an alternative method towards dedifferentiation of cells without genetic modification, which is preferable in the clinical situation."

Found inhibition in !Series_summary	"Muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1) is a muscle-specific protein implicated in the regulation of cardiac myocyte size and contractility. MuRF2, a closely related family member, redundantly interacts with protein substrates, and hetero-dimerizes with MuRF1. Mice lacking either MuRF1 or MuRF2 are phenotypically normal whereas mice lacking both proteins develop a spontaneous cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy indicating cooperative control of muscle mass by MuRF1 and MuRF2. In order to identify the role that MuRF1 plays in regulating cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we created transgenic mice expressing increased amounts of cardiac MuRF1. Adult MuRF1 transgenic (Tg+) hearts exhibited a non-progressive thinning of the left ventricular wall and a concomitant decrease in cardiac function. Experimental induction of cardiac hypertrophy by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) induced rapid failure of MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Microarray analysis identified that the levels of genes associated with metabolism (and in particular mitochondrial processes) were significantly altered in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, both at baseline and during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Surprisingly, ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ mice did not differ from wild type mice despite the depressed contractility following TAC. To explain this discrepancy between the ongoing heart failure and maintained ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, we compared the level and activity of creatine kinase (CK) between wild type and MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Although mCK and CK-M/B protein levels were unaffected in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, total CK activity was significantly inhibited. We conclude that MuRF1’s inhibition of CK activity leads to increased susceptibility to heart failure following TAC, demonstrating for the first time that MuRF1 regulates cardiac energetics in vivo."

Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"We explored the mechanistic involvement of the growth arrest and DNA damageinducible gene, GADD45a, in LPS- and ventilator-induced inflammatory lung injury (VILI). Multiple biochemical and genomic parameters of inflammatory lung injury indicated GADD45a-/- mice to be modestly susceptible to intratracheal LPS-induced lung injury and profoundly susceptible to high tidal volume ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) with increases in microvascular permeability and levels of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage. Expression profiling of lung tissues from GADD45a-/- mice revealed strong dysregulation in the B cell receptor signaling pathway suggesting involvement of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling components while the wild type controls depicted no observable changes. Western blot analyses of lung homogenates confirmed ~50% reduction in Akt protein levels in GADD45a-/- mice accompanied by marked increases in Akt ubiquitination. Electrical resistance measurements across human lung endothelial cell monolayers with either reduced GADD45a or Akt expression (siRNAs) revealed significant potentiation of LPS-induced human lung endothelial barrier dysfunction which was attenuated by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 transgene. These studies validate GADD45a as a novel candidate gene in inflammatory lung injury and a significant participant in vascular barrier regulation via effects on Akt-mediated endothelial signaling"

Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"Dlx3 over-expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts changed the expression level of numerous genes involved in osteogenesis and embryonic stem cell-related pathways as revealed by microarray analysis.  From the list of Dlx3 modulated genes we focused our attention on the study of two candidates, Lifr and Chrdl1.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the recruitment of Dlx3 transcription factor to the promoters of Lifr and Chrdl1, and luciferase assays confirmed the role of Dlx3 in the regulation of Lifr expression.  Over-expression of Dlx3 in mouse embryonic stem cells stimulated Lifr and Chrdl1 expression and inhibited expression of Id proteins and Bmp4.  We show that Dlx3 increases the expression of both soluble and transmembrane forms of Lifr.  Soluble Lifr may regulate extracellular Lif levels via solution binding, while transmembrane Lifr mediates the signal transduction pathway. The data suggests that Dlx3 may be involved in stem cell differentiation in a dosage dependent way through its interaction with Lifr and with Chrdl1, a known antagonist of Bmp4.  We speculate that Dlx3 may also be involved in osteoblast differentiation through interactions involving Lifr, Bmp, and Id proteins and signaling via the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways.  In summary, our data suggests that Dlx3 proteins play a significant role in a highly tuned network in early embryogenesis."

To assess the mechanisms involved in these effects, C/EBPα targets were identified  by microarray analyses.  Upon C/EBPα activation, expression of c-Myb and GATA-2 was  repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL, K562 and CML-BC primary cells but only c-Myb levels decreased slightly   in CD34+ normal progenitors. The role of these two genes for the biological effects of C/EBPα was assessed by perturbing their expression in K562 cells. Expression of c-Myb blocked the proliferation inhibition and differentiation-inducing effects of C/EBPα while c-Myb siRNA treatment enhanced C/EBPα-mediated proliferation inhibition and induced changes in gene expression indicative of monocytic  differentiation. GATA-2 expression suppressed the proliferation inhibitory effect of C/EBPα but blocked in part the effect on differentiation; GATA-2 siRNA treatment had no effects on C/EBPα induction of differentiation but inhibited proliferation of K562 cells, alone or upon C/EBPα activation. In summary, the effects of C/EBPα in p210BCR/ABL -expressing cells depend, in part, on transcriptional repression of c-Myb and GATA-2.

DGK r is 2 
Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"In addition to lipid second messengers derived from the plasma membrane, increasing evidence supports the existence of nuclear lipid-dependent signaling networks. Diacylglycerol is a key second messenger, generated at the nuclear level, which is metabolized by diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs). It has been demonstrated that nuclear DGK-ζ negatively regulates cell cycle progression. The aim of this study was to identify key determinants of nuclear DGK-ζ-dependent cell cycle arrest in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Using DNA microarrays, Real-Time RT-PCR and western blot, we demonstrated that nuclear DGK-ζ downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 and increased the expression of TIS21/BTG2/PC3, a transcriptional regulator of cyclin D1 with a strong anti-proliferative function. Overexpression of TIS21/BTG2/PC3 blocked the cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle and decreased the levels of Ser807/811 phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, similarly to overexpression of DGK-ζ. Moreover, during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, we showed an increase of TIS21/BTG2/PC3 expression and a decrease in cyclin D1 levels. siRNA downregulation of TIS21/BTG2/PC3 impaired myogenic differentiation by opposing cell cycle arrest. In summary, these data identify TIS21/BTG2/PC3 and cyclin D1 as downstream effectors of the nuclear DGK-ζ and highlight the importance of this DGK isoform in the regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation."

Furin-deficient effector cells were inherently overly active and were resistant to suppressive activity of wild-type Tregs. Thus, our results indicate that furin is indispensable in maintaining peripheral tolerance, which is due, at least in part, to its nonredundant, essential function in regulating TGFb-1 production.  Targeting furin has emerged as a strategy in malignant and infectious disease.  The current work suggests that inhibiting furin might activate immune responses, but may result in a breakdown in peripheral tolerance. "

We discovered that Lhx8 knockout females lose oocytes within 7 days after birth. At the time of birth, histological examination shows that Lhx8 deficient (Lhx8(-/-)) ovaries are grossly similar to the newborn wild type ovaries. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries fail to maintain the primordial follicles and the transition from primordial to growing follicles does not occur. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice. Our findings show that Lhx8 is a critical factor for maintenance and differentiation of the oocyte during early oogenesis and it acts in part by down-regulating the Nobox pathway."

Lhx8(-/-) ovaries fail to maintain the primordial follicles and the transition from primordial to growing follicles does not occur. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice. Our findings show that Lhx8 is a critical factor for maintenance and differentiation of the oocyte during early oogenesis and it acts in part by down-regulating the Nobox pathway."

Afp r is 5 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Background & Aims: MiRNAs are small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through imperfect complementarity with target messenger RNAs. The function of miRNA in mammalian organogenesis is largely unknown. Conditional loss-of-function of Dicer, the enzyme that processes precursor miRNA transcripts into their mature, active form, has been shown to cause severe defects in a number of organ systems. Here we address the role of Dicer in liver development and function. Methods: Mice lacking Dicer function in hepatocytes were generated using an Afp-Cre strain to drive deletion of a floxed Dicer allele. Deletion of the flox-dicer allele was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Decreased miRNA levels detected by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed loss of Dicer function. Gene expression microarray analysis was performed on liver RNA from P28 mutant and control mice. Liver sections from mutant and control mice ranging from embryonic stages through 3-4 months of age were examined and liver function tests were performed on adult mice. Results: Mice lacking hepatocyte Dicer function were born alive at the expected frequency, and had grossly normal appearance and behavior. Despite the loss of mature miRNA, hepatic function was normal, as reflected by normal blood gludose, albumin, cholesterol, and bilirubin. However, mutant mice between 2-4 months of age exhibit progressive hepatocyte damage, elevated ALT/AST, with evidence of balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the lobule. Microarray analysis indicates large-scale changes in gene expression, with increased expression of many miRNA targets, as well as imprinted genes. Conclusions: Loss of miRNA processing in the liver at late gestation has a remarkably mild phenotype, suggesting that miRNAs do not play an essential role in hepatic physiology. However, miRNA deficiency results in hepatocyte apoptosis and balanced hepatocyte regeneration. Finally, microarray analysis of gene expression in mutant liver suggests a previously unrecognized role for Dicer in the repression of imprinted genes."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"Results: Using microarray analysis, we investigated the transcriptional response downstream of the LTβR in mouse embryoni fibroblasts (MEF) and its regulation by the RelA and RelB subunits of NF-κB. We describe novel LTβR-responsive genes that are regulated by RelA and/or RelB. Interestingly, we found that the majority of LTβR-regulated genes require the presence of both RelA and RelB, suggesting significant crosstalk between the two NF-κB activation pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that LTβR-NF-κB target genes are predominantly involved in the regulation of immune responses. However, other biological processes, such as apoptosis/cell death, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and taxis were also regulated by LTβR signaling. Moreover, we show that activation of the LTβR inhibits the expression of a key adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (pparg), suggesting that LTβR signaling may interfere with adipogenic differentiation."

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"The epidermal specific ablation of Trp53 gene leads to the spontaneous development of aggressive tumors in mice through a process that is accelerated by the simultaneous ablation of Rb gene. Since alterations of p53-dependent pathway are common hallmarks of aggressive, poor prognostic human cancers, these mouse models can recapitulate the molecular features of some of these human malignancies. To evaluate this possibility, gene expression microarray analysis was performed in mouse samples. The mouse tumors display increased expression of cell cycle and chromosomal instability associated genes. Remarkably, they are also enriched in human embryonic stem cell gene signatures, a characteristic feature of human aggressive tumors. Using cross-species comparison and meta-analytical approaches, we also observed that spontaneous mouse tumors display robust similarities with gene expression profiles of human tumors bearing mutated TP53, or displaying poor prognostic outcome, from multiple body tissues. We have obtained a 20-gene signature whose genes are overexpressed in mouse tumors and can identify human tumors with poor outcome from breast cancer, astrocytoma and multiple myeloma. This signature was consistently overexpressed in additional mouse tumors using microarray analysis. Two of the genes of this signature, AURKA and UBE2C, were validated in human breast and cervical cancer as potential biomarkers of malignancy. Our analyses demonstrate that these mouse models are promising preclinical tools aimed to search for malignancy biomarkers and to test targeted therapies of prospective use in human aggressive tumors and/or with p53 mutation or inactivation."

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LMX1B binds to the proximal promoter region of IL-6 and IL-8 in vivo, in the vicinity of the characterized kappa B site, and that LMX1B recruitment correlates with an increased NF-kappa B DNA association. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of p65 impairs LMX1B-dependent induction of NF-kappa B target genes, while activation of NF-kappa B activity by TNF-alpha results in a synergistic induction of these genes by LMX1B. IL-6 promoter-driven reporter assays showed that the kappa B site and an adjacent putative LMX1B binding motif are both involved in LMX1B-mediated transcription. Expression of a number of NF-kappa B target genes is affected in the kidney of Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice, thus supporting the biological relevance of the data obtained in the human cell line. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LMX1B directly regulates transcription of a subset of NF-kappa B target genes in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-kappa B."

Methods: At 35 days of age, 12 weaned Il10-/- and 12 C57 mice were randomly assigned to one of two modified AIN-76A diets, supplemented with 3.7% purified ethyl esters of either EPA (n-3) or oleic acid (OA, control). To identify genes relevant to colon inflammation, transcription profiling (microarrays and qRT-PCR) and bioinformatic analyses were used. Results: In this study, dietary EPA reversed the decrease in colon fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression observed in OA-fed Il10-/- compared to C57 mice. Il10-/- mice fed the OA diet showed decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, as well as those involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, compared to C57 mice on the same diet. In contrast, dietary EPA increased the expression of these genes in Il10-/- mice. Conclusions: These data indicate that dietary EPA induced endogenous lipid oxidation which might have a potential anti-inflammatory effect on colon tissue. This is supported by the activation of the Ppara gene that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes and proteins."

Found exposure in !Series_summary	"The growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) promotes the survival and growth of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and stimulates myelopoiesis.  It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  We used kinetic microarray, Northern Blotting and bioinformatics analysis of IL-3 dependent myeloblasts to determine whether IL-3 acts in part by regulating the rate of turnover of mRNA transcripts in specific functional pathways.  Our results indicate that exposure of myeloblasts to IL-3 causes immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function.  Examples include transcripts associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation (pik3cd, myb, pim-1), hematopoietic development (cited2), differentiation control (cdkn1a) and RNA processing (BRF1, BRF2).  A domain in the 3’-utr of IL-6 that mediates IL-3 responsiveness contains AU-rich elements that bind proteins known to modulate mRNA stability, however a known destabilizing protein (AUF1) is shown not to mediate degradation in the absence of IL-3.    These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of this network of transcripts could contribute to growth patterns observed in leukemia."

Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin maintains energy balance by acting on hypothalamic leptin receptors (Leprs) that trigger the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Although disruption of Lepr-Stat3 signaling promotes obesity in mice, other features of Lepr function, such as fertility, seem normal, pointing to the involvement of additional regulators. Here we show that the cyclic AMP responsive element–binding protein-1 (Creb1)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1) is required for energy balance and reproduction—Crtc1-/- mice are hyperphagic, obese and infertile. Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice; leptin administration increased amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1 stimulated expression of the Cartpt and Kiss1 genes, which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin’s effects on satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing Lepr and these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1 polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, our results indicate that the Creb1-Crtc1 pathway mediates the central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and fertility."

Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice; leptin administration increased amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1 stimulated expression of the Cartpt and Kiss1 genes, which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin’s effects on satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing Lepr and these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1 polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, our results indicate that the Creb1-Crtc1 pathway mediates the central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and fertility."

Mouse embryos lacking Insm1 contained half the number of basal progenitors and showed a marked reduction in cortical plate radial thickness. Forced premature expression of Insm1 in neuroepithelial cells resulted in their mitosis occurring at the basal (rather than apical) side of the ventricular zone and induced expression of the basal progenitor marker Tbr2. Remarkably,  these cells remained negative for Tis21, a marker of neurogenic progenitors, and did not generate neurons but underwent self-amplification.

Found induced in !Series_summary	"Th2 cells enable humoral immunity and host-defense to parasites. Whereas IL-4 drives Th2 differentiation and IL-2 is important later in this process by augmenting IL4 chromatin accessibility, we demonstrate that IL-2 serves an essential early role in regulating IL-4Rα expression by inducing binding of Stat5a and Stat5b to the IL4ra locus, with sustained binding during Th2 differentiation.  Although IL-4 induces IL-4Rα expression, TCR-induced IL-4Rα expression was unexpectedly normal in ILr-/- but profoundly diminished in IL2-/- T cells. Remarkably, enforced IL-4Rα expression rescued Th2 differentiation in IL2-/- cells. These results reveal a novel function for IL-2, with IL-2 via Stat5 providing an early signal for IL4ra induction, thereby priming cells for Th2 differentiation and promoting/maintaining IL-4Rα expression in Th2-committed cells."

Found expressing in !Series_summary	"The prevention of autoimmunity requires elimination of self-reactive T cells during their development and maturation. Expression of diverse self-antigens by stromal cells in the thymus is essential to this process, and depends, in part, on the activity of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) gene. Here we report the identification of extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) resident within the secondary lymphoid organs. These stromally-derived eTACs express a diverse array of unique self-antigens and are capable of interacting with and deleting naive autoreactive T cells. Using two-photon microscopy we observe stable, antigen-specific interactions between eTACs and autoreactive T cells. We propose that such a secondary network of self-antigen-expressing stromal cells may help reinforce immune tolerance by preventing the maturation of autoreactive T cells that escape thymic negative selection."

BDC T cells were a mixture of cells expressing high, intermediate and low levels of the T cell receptor. Clonotype-low BDC T cells were required for LTP. Furthermore, islet infiltrating leukocytes in the LTP mice contained Foxp3+CD4 T cells. Islet inflammation in both diabetic and LTP mice was characterized by heavy infiltration of macrophages. Gene expression profiles indicated that macrophages in diabetic mice were M1-type, while LTP mice contained M2-differentiated. The LTP was abolished if mice were treated with either an antibody depleting CD4 T cells, or a neutralizing antibody to CTLA-4, in this case, only at a late stage. Neutralization of IL-10, TGF-β, GITR or CD25 had no effect. Transfer of only clonotype-high expressing BDC T cells induced diabetes but in contrast, H22 antibodies did not inhibit diabetes. While clonotype high T cells induced diabetes even when IFN-γ was neutralized, paradoxically, there was reduced inflammation and no diabetes if host myeloid cells lacked IFN-γ receptor. Hence, using monoclonal CD4 T cells, IFN-γ can have a wide diversity of roles, depending on the setting of the immune process."

Human ARF is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene, mainly in association with the simultaneous deletion of INK4A.  However, questions remain as to whether loss of ARF alone is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis.  Here we report that mice deficient for Arf are susceptible to accelerated asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma (MM).  MMs arising in Arf (+/-) mice consistently exhibit biallelic inactivation of Arf, but unexpectedly, do not acquire additional recurrent genetic alterations that we previously identified in asbestos-induced MMs arising in Nf2 (+/-) mice.  Array CGH analysis was used to detect a recurrent deletion at chromosome 4C6.  A candidate in this region, Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1), was further explored because it encodes a protein implicated in tumor cell survival and in the pathogenesis of some human tumor types.  We confirmed hemizygous loss of Faf1 and down regulation of Faf1 protein in a series of MMs from Arf (+/-) mice, and then showed that Faf1 regulates TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB signaling, a mechanism previously implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis of human mesothelial cells.  Collectively, these investigations divulge important information regarding the significance of Arf inactivation in MM pathogenesis, and implicate Faf1 as a key component in the TNFalpha/NFkappaB signaling node that has now been independently implicated in the asbestos-induced oncogenesis."

Human ARF is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene, mainly in association with the simultaneous deletion of INK4A.  However, questions remain as to whether loss of ARF alone is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis.  Here we report that mice deficient for Arf are susceptible to accelerated asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma (MM).  MMs arising in Arf (+/-) mice consistently exhibit biallelic inactivation of Arf, but unexpectedly, do not acquire additional recurrent genetic alterations that we previously identified in asbestos-induced MMs arising in Nf2 (+/-) mice.  Array CGH analysis was used to detect a recurrent deletion at chromosome 4C6.  A candidate in this region, Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1), was further explored because it encodes a protein implicated in tumor cell survival and in the pathogenesis of some human tumor types.  We confirmed hemizygous loss of Faf1 and down regulation of Faf1 protein in a series of MMs from Arf (+/-) mice, and then showed that Faf1 regulates TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB signaling, a mechanism previously implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis of human mesothelial cells.  Collectively, these investigations divulge important information regarding the significance of Arf inactivation in MM pathogenesis, and implicate Faf1 as a key component in the TNFalpha/NFkappaB signaling node that has now been independently implicated in the asbestos-induced oncogenesis."

We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found.

Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The Tec-family kinase Itk plays an important role during T-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like T-cell development. We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found. Taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of Itk."

The replacement of selenoprotein synthesis in mice carrying mutant Trsp transgenes, wherein housekeeping, but not stress-related selenoproteins are expressed, led to normal expression of phase II response genes.

In NIH3T3  cells, cell density and Hippo signaling regulated the activity of Tead proteins by  modulating nuclear localization of a Yki homologue, Yap, and the resulting change in  Tead activity altered cell proliferation. Tead2-VP16 mimicked Yap overexpression,  including increased cell proliferation, reduced cell death, promotion of EMT, lack of cell  contact inhibition, and promotion of tumor formation. Growth promoting activities of  various Yap mutants correlated with their Tead-coactivator activities. Tead2-VP16 and  Yap regulated largely overlapping sets of genes.

In the present study, we have analyzed in vivo-induced Ag-specific CD4 TR cells with respect to their molecular and functional phenotype. By comparative genomics we could show that these Ag-specific TR cells induced by chronic Ag stimulation in vivo clearly differ in their genetic program from naturally occurring thymus-derived CD4 CD25  TR cells. This distinct population of induced TR cells express neither CD25 nor the TR-associated transcription factor Foxp3. Strikingly, CD25 is not even up-regulated upon stimulation. Despite the lack in Foxp3 expression, these in vivo-induced CD25  TR cells are able to interfere with an Ag-specific CD8  T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation without significant increase in CD25 and Foxp3 expression.

Aoh2 r is 2 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"The mouse aldehyde oxidase, Aoh2 (aldehyde oxidase homolog 2), is a molybdo-flavoenzyme.  Harderian glands are the richest source of Aoh2, although  the protein is detectable also in sebaceous glands, epidermis and other keratinized epithelia.  The levels of Aoh2 in the Harderian gland and skin are controlled by genetic background, being maximal in CD1 or C57BL/6 and minimal in DBA/2, CBA or 129/Sv strains.  Testosterone is a negative regulator of Aoh2 in Harderian glands.  Homogenously purified Aoh2 oxidizes retinaldehyde into retinoic acid efficiently, while it is devoid of pyridoxal oxidizing activity, unlike other aldehyde oxidases.  Aoh2  knockout mice are viable and fertile, although they have an absolute deficit of retinaldehyde oxidase activity in the Harderian gland, decreased retinoic acid levels, and down-regulation of retinoid-dependent genes.  The Harderian gland’s transcriptome of knockout mice is characterized by perturbations in pathways controlling lipid homeostasis and cellular secretion.  This is particularly evident in sexually immature animals.  Lower amounts of retinoic acid are also observed in the skin of Aoh2-/- animals.  Knockout mice have thickening of the epidermis in basal conditions and after UV light exposure.  This has correlates in the skin transcriptome, which shows enrichment and overall up-regulation of genes involved in hypertrophic responses."

MYC r is 1 
Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"The MYC oncogene has been implicated in the regulation of up to thousands of genes involved in many cellular programs including proliferation, growth, differentiation, self-renewal, and apoptosis. MYC is thought to induce cancer through an exaggerated effect on these physiologic programs. Which of these genes are responsible for the ability of MYC to initiate and/or maintain tumorigenesis is not clear. Previously, we have shown that upon brief MYC inactivation, some tumors undergo sustained regression. Here we demonstrate that upon MYC inactivation there are global permanent changes in gene expression detected by microarray analysis. By applying StepMiner analysis, we identified genes whose expression most strongly correlated with the ability of MYC to induce a neoplastic state. Notably, genes were identified that exhibited permanent changes in mRNA expression upon MYC inactivation. Importantly, permanent changes in gene expression could be shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to be associated with permanent changes in the ability of MYC to bind to the promoter regions. Our list of candidate genes associated with tumor maintenance was further refined by comparing our analysis with other published results to generate a gene signature associated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. To validate the role of gene signatures associated with MYC in human tumorigenesis, we examined the expression of human homologs in 273 published human lymphoma microarray datasets in Affymetrix U133A format. One large functional group of these genes included the ribosomal structural proteins. In addition, we identified a group of genes involved in a diverse array of cellular functions including: BZW2, H2AFY, SFRS3, NAP1L1, NOLA2, UBE2D2, CCNG1, LIFR, FABP3, and EDG1. Hence, through our analysis of gene expression in murine tumor models and human lymphomas, we have identified a novel gene signature correlated with the ability of MYC to maintain tumorigenesis."

PrPC r is 5 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Over-expression of wild type PrP in skeletal muscles is sufficient to cause a primary myopathy with no signs of peripheral neuropathy, possibly due to accumulation of a cytotoxic truncated form of PrP and/or PrP aggregation.  In this study we used DNA microarrays to identify 1499 transcripts that are temporally deregulated concomitant with inducible PrPC over-expression in the skeletal muscles of transgenic mice.  Examination using microarrays revealed a transcriptional profile with both similarities and differences to previously investigated models of myopathies.  Down-regulation of genes coding for the myofibrillar proteins MYH2, MYH6, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3 and up-regulation of lysosomal genes CTSS, CTSD, CTSZ, DPEP2, HEXA, HEXB and LAMP1 coincide with the observed myopathy and lysosome accumulation on over-expression of PrPC.  Down-regulation of the MEF2C gene, a key regulatory transcriptional factor muscle development and remodeling of adult muscles in response to physiologic and pathologic signals, may contribute to the centrally placed nuclei in the skeletal muscles.  Significantly, up-regulation of genes involved in p53 signaling and the induction of p53 protein, suggest a central role for this molecule in the myopathy.  Several p53-regulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest (CDNK1A, GADD45a and GADD45b) and apoptosis (BAK1, PMAIP1, BBC3, and BAX) are induced. We suggest that PrPC over-expression in skeletal muscles, possibly in response to accumulation of a cytotoxic truncated form of PrP, causes a primary myopathy involving the induction of p53-dependent pathways.

GAP-43 r is 1 
Found KO in !Series_summary	"Mice lacking the growth associated protein, GAP-43, (KO) show multiple deficits in forebrain axon guidance and cortical cell differentiation (Donovan and McCasland, 2005). As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser  microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis. Expression profiling and functional gene group analysis of RNA from WT, HZ, and KO cortex at postnatal day 5 was performed. We identified thousands of transcripts differentially expressed across the genotypes. Verification of selected changes in gene expression was accomplished using in situ hybridization. Our results suggest an adaptive modification in transcript expression of genes involved in cell-cell communication and synaptogenesis. These modifications appear important in forward and reverse signaling as well as maintaining synchrony between the cells. Compensatory up- and down regulation of synapse-associated genes may explain the reverse in HZ phenotype from P7 to P26. Moreover, these findings provide new insight into the role GAP-43 plays in several pathways associated with synaptogenesis and trans-synaptic signaling."

GAP-43 r is 3 
Found KO in !Series_summary	"Mice lacking the growth associated protein, GAP-43, (KO) show multiple deficits in forebrain axon guidance and cortical cell differentiation (Donovan and McCasland, 2005). As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser  microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis.

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as high-grade disease that typically harbors EGFR, PTEN and Ink4a/Arf mutations, and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and p53 events1.  Here, we show that concomitant CNS-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with striking clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans.  This genetic observation prompted p53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of p53 as well the expected PTEN mutations.  Integrated transcriptomic profling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives elevated c-Myc levels and its associated signature.  Functional studies validated increased c-Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of p53-Pten null NSCs as well as tumor neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model.  c-Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53-Pten null TNSs. These murine modeling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumor suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish c-Myc as a key target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential."

The genetically-engineered ES cell lines were generated to analyze the function of Rex1 in the maintenance of pluripotency and to analyze its gain- and loss-of function. For loss-of-function analysis, we disrupted the endogenous Rex1 allele by conventional gene targeting via homologous recombination in ES cells. The knock-out (KO) allele should be a functionally null allele because the first 100 bp of the open reading frame in the exon 4 including the start codon was replaced by the pacEGFP chimeric gene cassette containing the puromycin-resistant gene (pac) and the green fluorescent protein (Egfp) cDNA. Interestingly, all of the puromycin resistant clones obtained by transfection of this KO vector carried the correctly targeted alleles. One of the Rex1+/- ES cell line (RKPG9) was cultured with high-dose puromycin to obtain the Rex1-/- ES cell lines generated via spontaneous gene conversion. Multiple Rex1-/- ES cell lines were established with extremely high efficiency (4 of 4 clones obtained after the selection were homozygous for Rex1 KO allele). Correct targeting events were confirmed by the loss of the polymorphic signature of the wild-type allele on the southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA, in which the 5.6 kb fragment corresponds to the Rex1 pseudogene on chromosome 15 reported previously as well as found in the mouse genome data. Northern blot revealed the loss of the transcript derived from the wild-type allele in Rex1-/- ES cells, which express the large transcripts composed by the truncated Rex1 and pacEGFP. Rex1-/- ES cells were also established by introduction of the second knockout vector carrying the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker."

The knock-out (KO) allele should be a functionally null allele because the first 100 bp of the open reading frame in the exon 4 including the start codon was replaced by the pacEGFP chimeric gene cassette containing the puromycin-resistant gene (pac) and the green fluorescent protein (Egfp) cDNA. Interestingly, all of the puromycin resistant clones obtained by transfection of this KO vector carried the correctly targeted alleles. One of the Rex1+/- ES cell line (RKPG9) was cultured with high-dose puromycin to obtain the Rex1-/- ES cell lines generated via spontaneous gene conversion. Multiple Rex1-/- ES cell lines were established with extremely high efficiency (4 of 4 clones obtained after the selection were homozygous for Rex1 KO allele). Correct targeting events were confirmed by the loss of the polymorphic signature of the wild-type allele on the southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA, in which the 5.6 kb fragment corresponds to the Rex1 pseudogene on chromosome 15 reported previously as well as found in the mouse genome data. Northern blot revealed the loss of the transcript derived from the wild-type allele in Rex1-/- ES cells, which express the large transcripts composed by the truncated Rex1 and pacEGFP. Rex1-/- ES cells were also established by introduction of the second knockout vector carrying the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker."

Cav r is 3 
Found -/- in !Series_summary	"Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in striated and smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine if genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we next studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3 (-/-) null mice. Interestingly, detailed analysis of Cav-3 (-/-) virgin mammary glands shows dramatic increases in ductal thickness, side-branching, and the development of extensive lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Analysis by genome-wide expression profiling reveals the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. The expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc are also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly show that Cav-3 (-/-) mice undergo precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic implantation of a transformed mammary cell line (known as Met-1), we demonstrate that virgin Cav-3 (-/-) mice are dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Interestingly, Cav-3 (+/-) mice also show similar protection, indicating that even reductions in Cav-3 levels are sufficient to render these mice resistant to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cav-3 (-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a constitutive lactogenic microenviroment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic micro-environment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. Most importantly, a lactation-based therapeutic strategy would provide a more natural and nontoxic approach to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies."

To determine if genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we next studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3 (-/-) null mice. Interestingly, detailed analysis of Cav-3 (-/-) virgin mammary glands shows dramatic increases in ductal thickness, side-branching, and the development of extensive lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Analysis by genome-wide expression profiling reveals the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. The expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc are also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly show that Cav-3 (-/-) mice undergo precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic implantation of a transformed mammary cell line (known as Met-1), we demonstrate that virgin Cav-3 (-/-) mice are dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Interestingly, Cav-3 (+/-) mice also show similar protection, indicating that even reductions in Cav-3 levels are sufficient to render these mice resistant to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cav-3 (-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a constitutive lactogenic microenviroment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic micro-environment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. Most importantly, a lactation-based therapeutic strategy would provide a more natural and nontoxic approach to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies."

Here we report expression profiling of mouse ovaries that lack Foxl2 alone or in combination with Wnt4 or Kit/c-Kit, to identify ovarian targets of Foxl2 that, along with some testis genes, were dysregulated during embryonic development. Loss of one copy of Foxl2 revealed strong gene dosage sensitivity, with molecular anomalies that were milder but resembled ovaries lacking both Foxl2 alleles. Furthermore, a Foxl2 transgene disrupted embryonic testis differentiation and increased the levels of key female markers. The results, including a comprehensive principal component analysis of published microarray datasets 1) support the proposal of dose-dependent Foxl2 function and anti-testis action throughout ovary differentiation; and 2) identify candidate genes for a role in sex determination independent of FOXL2 (notably, the transcription factor, ZBTB7C) and in the generation of the ovarian reserve downstream of it (e.g., the cadherin-domain protein CLSTN2, or the sphingomyelin synthase, SGMS2).

Recent studies have demonstrated that this pathway is integral to a complex system of interactions, involving as well other signal transduction pathways, and implicated in distinct human diseases. Delta-like 1 (Dll1) is one of the known ligands of the Notch receptors. The role of the Notch ligands is less well understood. Loss-of-function of Dll1 leads to embryonic lethality, but reduction of Delta-like 1 protein levels has not been studied in adult stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present the haploinsufficient phenotype of Dll1 and a missense mutant Dll1 allele (Dll1(C413Y)). Haploinsufficiency leads to a complex phenotype with several biological processes altered. These alterations reveal the importance of Dll1 mainly in metabolism, energy balance and in immunology. The animals are smaller, lighter, with altered fat to lean ratio and have increased blood pressure and a slight bradycardia. The animals have reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels in blood. At the immunological level a subtle phenotype is observed due to the effect and fine-tuning of the signaling network at the different levels of differentiation, proliferation and function of lymphocytes. Moreover, the importance of the proteolytic regulation of the Notch signaling network emphasized.

In the embryo, expression of Gata3, like Cdx2, depends on Tead4, and expression of both factors becomes restricted to nascent trophoblast by an Oct4-independent mechanism. These observations place Tead4 at the top of a trophoblast hierarchy, with Gata3 and Cdx2 acting downstream to induce expression of common and independent targets in this lineage."

THP r is 3 
Found overexpressing in !Series_summary	"Expression of meningioma 1 (MN1) has been proposed to be a negative prognostic molecular marker in adult AML with normal cytogenetics, however its role in pediatric leukemia is unknown. We found elevated MN1 expression in 53 of 88 pediatric leukemia cases: significant amounts of MN1 were found in immature B-cell ALL and most cases of infant leukemia but no MN1 expression was detected in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Interestingly 17 of 19 cases harboring MLL-X fusions showed also elevated MN1 expression. Lentiviral siRNA mediated MN1 knock-down resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of 3 MLL-X-positive human leukemia cell lines overexpressing MN1 (THP-1, RS4;11, MOLM13). In a mouse MLL/ENL-induced leukemia MN1 overexpression resulted from retroviral provirus insertion. Strikingly co-expression of MN1 with MLL/ENL resulted in significantly reduced latency for induction of an AML phenotype in mice suggesting functional cooperation. MN1 overexpression in MLL/ENL-carrying cells resulted in expansion of the L-GMP population and facilitated disease induction in secondary recipients. Gene expression profiling allowed to define a number of potential MN1 hematopoietic targets. Up-regulation of CD34, FLT3, HLF, or DLK1 was validated in bone marrow transiently overexpressing MN1, in MN1-induced mouse leukemias, as well as in some cases of pediatric leukemias overexpressing MN1. Taken together, our work suggests that MN1 overexpression is essential for growth of leukemic cells, and that MN1 can act as a cooperating oncogene with MLL-X fusion genes most probably through modification of a distinct gene expression program that leads to expansion of a leukemia initiating cell population.

Esrrb reprogrammed cells share similar expression and epigenetic signatures as ES cells. These cells are also pluripotent and can differentiate in vitro and in vivo into the three major embryonic cell lineages. Furthermore, these cells contribute to mouse chimeras and are germline transmissible. In ES cells, Esrrb targets many genes involved in selfrenewal and pluripotency. This suggests that Esrrb may mediate reprogramming through the up-regulation of ES cell-specific genes. Our findings also indicate that it is possible to reprogram MEFs without exogenous Klf transcription factors and link a nuclear receptor to somatic cell reprogramming."

Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism and have been extensively studied in liver, macrophages and adipose tissue. However, their role in skeletal muscle is not yet fully elucidated and the functional role of each of the LXRα and LXRβ subtypes in skeletal muscle is at present unknown. To study the importance of each of the receptor subtypes, myotube cultures derived from wild type (WT), LXRα and LXRβ knockout (KO) mice were established. The present study shows that treatment with the unselective LXR agonist T0901317 increased mRNA levels of LXR target genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in myotubes established from WT and LXRα KO mice. However, only minor changes in expression level were observed for these genes after treatment with T0901317 in myotubes from LXRβ KO mice. Gene expression analysis using Affymetrix NuGO Genechip arrays showed that few other genes than the classical, well known LXR target genes were regulated by LXR in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, functional studies using radiolabeled substrates showed that treatment with T0901317 increased lipogenesis and apoA1 dependent cholesterol efflux, in myotubes from WT and LXRα KO mice, but not LXRβ KO mice. The data suggest that the lipogenic effects of LXRs, as well as the LXR-stimulated cholesterol efflux, are mainly mediated by LXRβ in skeletal muscle."

Sin3 r is 8 
Found silencing in !Series_summary	"The multi-subunit Sin3 co-repressor complex regulates gene transcription through deacetylation of nucleosomes. However, the full range of Sin3 activities and targets is not well understood. Here, we have investigated genome-wide binding of mouse Sin3 and RBP2 as well as histone modifications and nucleosome positioning as a function of myogenic differentiation. Remarkably, we find that Sin3 complexes spread immediately downstream of the transcription start site on repressed and transcribed genes during differentiation. We show that RBP2 is part of a Sin3 complex, and on a subset of E2F4 target genes, the coordinated activity of Sin3 and RBP2 leads to deacetylation, demethylation, and repositioning of nucleosomes. Our work provides evidence for coordinated binding of Sin3, chromatin modifications, and chromatin remodeling within discrete regulatory regions, suggesting a model in which spreading of Sin3 binding is ultimately linked to permanent gene silencing on a subset of E2F4 target genes.

PPARalpha r is 2 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Most of the transcriptional changes induced by PFOS in the fetal mouse liver and lung were related to activation of PPARalpha.  When compared to the transcript profiles induced by PFOA (Pubmed ID 17681415), few remarkable differences were found other than up-regulation of Cyp3a genes.  Because PFOS and PFOA have been shown to differ in their mode of action in the murine neonate, these data suggest that changes related to PFOS-induced neonatal toxicity may not be evident in the fetal transcriptome at term."

Foxp3 r is 3 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells originate primarily from thymic differentiation, but conversion of mature T lymphocytes to Foxp3 positivity can be elicited by several means, including in vitro activation in the presence of TGF-beta. Retinoic acid (RA) increases TGF-beta-induced expression of Foxp3, through unknown molecular mechanisms. We showed here that, rather than enhancing TGF-beta signaling directly in naive CD4(+) T cells, RA negatively regulated an accompanying population of CD4(+) T cells with a CD44(hi) memory and effector phenotype. These memory cells actively inhibited the TGF-beta-induced conversion of naive CD4(+) T cells through the synthesis of a set of cytokines (IL-4, IL-21, IFN-gamma) whose expression was coordinately curtailed by RA. This indirect effect was evident in vivo and required the expression of the RA receptor alpha. Thus, cytokine-producing CD44(hi) cells actively restrain TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 expression in naive T cells, and this balance can be shifted or fine-tuned by RA."

Srf r is 1 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor that binds to the serum response element (SRE) of genes that are expressed in response to mitogens. SRF plays essential roles in muscle and nervous system development; however, little is known about the role of SRF during liver growth and function. To examine the function of SRF in the liver, we generated mice in which the Srf gene was specifically disrupted in hepatocytes. The survival of mice lacking hepatic SRF activity was lower than that of control mice; moreover, surviving mutant mice were smaller and had lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels compared with control mice. Srf-deficient livers were also smaller than control livers, hepatocyte morphology was abnormal, and liver-cell proliferation and viability was compromised. Gene array and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of SRF depleted livers revealed a reduction in mRNAs encoding components of the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway, cyclins, several metabolic regulators, and cytochrome p450 enzymes. Conclusion: SRF is essential for hepatocyte proliferation and survival, liver function, and control of postnatal body growth by regulating hepatocyte gene expression."

SPARC-null mice have altered basement membranes and develop posterior sub-capsular cataracts with cell swelling and equatorial vacuoles.  Exchange of fluid, nutrients, and waste products in the avascular lens is driven by a unique circulating ion current.  Here we demonstrate that SPARC-null mouse lenses exhibit abnormal circulation of fluid, ion, and small molecules which leads to altered fluorescein distribution in vivo, loss of resting membrane polarization, and altered distribution of small molecules.  Microarray analysis of SPARC-null lenses showed changes in gene expression of ion channels and receptors, matrix and adhesion genes, cytoskeleton, immune response genes, and cell signaling molecules.  Our results demonstrate that the regulation of SPARC on cell-capsular matrix interactions can influence the circulation of fluid and ions in the lens, and the phenotype in the SPARC-null mouse lens is the result of multiple intersecting pathways."

Rb r is 3 
Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"The retinoblastoma cell cycle regulator pRb and the two related proteins p107 and p130 are thought to suppress cancer development both by inhibiting the G1/S transition of the cell cycle in response to growth-arrest signals and by promoting cellular differentiation. Here, we investigated the phenotype of Rb family triple knock-out (TKO) embryonic stem cells as they differentiate in vivo and in culture. Confirming the central role of the Rb gene family in cell cycle progression, TKO mouse embryos did not survive past mid-gestation and differentiating TKO cells displayed increased proliferation and cell death. However, patterning and cell fate determination were largely unaffected in these TKO embryos. Furthermore, a number of TKO cells, including in the neural lineage, were able to exit the cell cycle in G1 and terminally differentiate. This ability of Rb family TKO cells to undergo cell cycle arrest was associated with the repression of target genes for the E2F6 transcription factor, uncovering a pRb-independent control of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. These results show that the Rb gene family is required for proper embryonic development but is not absolutely essential to induce G1 arrest and differentiation in certain lineages."

Hnrpll r is 3

Differentiation of memory B cells involves irreversible encountered antigen, resulting from clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and differentiation into specialised memory cells. Differentiation of memory B cells involves irrversible DNA rearrangements and mutations, but differentiation of memory T cells is less understood. In an ENU screen for mouse mutations affecting the proportion of T cells with known memory cell markers, such as the alternative spliced Ptprc isoform CD45RO, we identified an inducible RNA-binding protein of previously unknown function, hnRNPLL (gene symbol Hnrpll), whose mutation abolishes the regulated silencing of CD45RABC exons in T cells and other leukocytes. In the mutant, a single amino acid substitution destabilizes an RNA-recognition domain that binds with micromolar affinity to RNA containing the Ptprc ARS exon silencing sequence. Hnrpll mutations selectively diminishes T cell accumulation in peripheral lymphoid tissues but not proliferation. Exon array analysis of Hnrpll mutant naive and memory T cells reveals an extensive program of alternative mRNA splicing in memory T cells coordinated by hnRNPLL.

leptin r is 7 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells."

Zfx deficiency in peripheral B cells caused impaired generation of the B-1 cell lineage, accelerated B cell turnover, depletion of mature recirculating cells, and delayed T-dependent antibody responses. Zfx-deficient B cells showed normal proximal BCR signaling, but impaired BCR-induced proliferation and survival.

Thus, Zfx restrains the stress response and couples antigen receptor signaling to B cell expansion and maintenance during development and peripheral homeostasis."

Unlike normal skin fibroblasts (NSF) or TAF (TAF-TIB6) from TIB6 tumors that are sensitive to anti-VEGF treatment, TAF (TAF-EL4) from resistant EL4 tumors can stimulate TIB6 tumor growth even when VEGF is inhibited.  We show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-C is upregulated in TAFs from resistant tumors. PDGF-C neutralizing antibodies blocked the angiogenesis induced by such TAF in vivo and slowed the growth of EL4 and admixture (TAF-EL4 + TIB6) tumors and exhibited additive effects with anti-VEGF-A antibodies. Hence, our data reveal a novel mechanism for TAF mediated tumorigenesis and suggest that some tumors may overcome inhibition of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis through upregulation of PDGF-C"

During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

This IkB-superrepresser is undegradable upon ubiquitinylation initialized by Ikk dependent phosphorylation and therefore impedes NFkB activity."

Each individual sample was hybridized aginst a universal reference mouse pool (Stratagene) on a two-color microarray. Furthermore was each sample/reference hybridization conducted as a dye swap experiment yielding two technical replicates with inverted dye channel orientation per sample. In addition a biological control using wildtype liver tissue from mice of the same genetic background was hybridized the same way aginst a universal reference. The latter was used to build a sample/control ratio for displays of indirect comparison."

Found null in !Series_summary	"Cyclin D1 belongs to the core cell cycle machinery1, and it is frequently overexpressed in human cancers2.  The full repertoire of cyclin D1 functions in normal development and in cancer cells is currently unknown. To address this question, here we introduce a novel approach that allows one to determine the set of cyclin D1-interacting proteins  (D1 “interactome”) and cyclin D1-bound genomic fragments (D1 “cistrome”) in essentially any mouse organ, at any point of development or at any stage of cancer progression.   Using this approach, we detected several novel tissue-specific interactors of cyclin D1.  A significant number of these partners represent proteins involved in transcription.  We show, using genome-wide location analysis3, that cyclin D1 occupies promoters of a very large number of genes in the developing mouse, where it binds in close proximity to transcription start sites.  Bioinformatics analyses of cyclin D1-bound genomic segments in the developing embryo revealed DNA recognition sequences for several transcription factors.  By querying SAGE libraries4, promoter CpG content5 and gene expression profiles of cyclin D1-null organs, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 binds promoters of highly expressed genes, and that it functions to activate or to repress gene expression in vivo.  Analyses of cyclin D1 transcriptional targets reveal that cyclin D1 contributes to cell proliferation by upregulating genes required for S-phase entry and progression.  Hence, cyclin D1 plays a broad transcriptional regulatory function in vivo during normal mouse development."

Bioinformatics analyses of cyclin D1-bound genomic segments in the developing embryo revealed DNA recognition sequences for several transcription factors.  By querying SAGE libraries4, promoter CpG content5 and gene expression profiles of cyclin D1-null organs, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 binds promoters of highly expressed genes, and that it functions to activate or to repress gene expression in vivo.  Analyses of cyclin D1 transcriptional targets reveal that cyclin D1 contributes to cell proliferation by upregulating genes required for S-phase entry and progression.  Hence, cyclin D1 plays a broad transcriptional regulatory function in vivo during normal mouse development."

Using a conditional null allele of the gene encoding p56Lck we show here that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling is also essential for sustaining the phenotype and homeostasis of Treg cells.  Inactivation of p56Lck in Treg cells resulted in large-scale changes in their gene expression profile, blocked their capacity to suppress responses, inhibited their proliferation, and caused them to redistribute in the body.  The results make clear multiple aspects of the Treg cell phenotype that are dependent on a sustained capacity to respond through their TCRs."

We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia.  To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappa-B, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) and PCN (pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile) are inducers of drug metabolism through activation of nuclear receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor), respectively. Mouse experiment was designed to study the effect of CAR and PXR activation on cholesterol homeostasis genes and other genes, which are present on the Steroltalk v2 microarray. Treatments were combined with standard and high-cholesterol diet to observe the interference of high liver cholesterol on nuclear receptor transcription regulation. All experiments were done within the European sixth Framework program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results form these experiments give new knowledge about involvement of ‘xenosensors’ CAR and PXR in regulation of endogenous liver metabolism."

The proliferation of fibroblasts derived from Day 12.5  knock out embryos was also decreased as compared to that of wild type cells. Microarray expression analysis revealed changes in genes important in cell growth including members of the MAPK signal transduction pathway. In addition, the expression or activation of proliferation related genes such as AKT and the androgen receptor, previously demonstrated to be affected by Ebp1 expression in vitro,  were altered in adult tissues."

NF r is 2 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Pneumonia is a serious problem worldwide.  We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia.  To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection."

Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3). The other 18 genes were all involved in different processes. Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10). These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs of the C57Bl/6 aorta at an atherosclerosis-prone location. This is in agreement with findings in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis-prone regions. It could be due to biomechanical differences, for instance in wall tension or shear stress, or the different embryological origin of SMCs in AA and TA."

The 201 genes that showed exclusively differential expression in apoE-/- mice were related to processes involved in atherosclerosis, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, motility and death, lipid metabolism and immune responses. Furthermore, the transcription profile of the AA was in accordance with a more synthetic SMC phenotype. These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs in the aorta of apoE-/- mice at the atherosclerosis-prone location before actual lesion development. This suggests that SMCs, in addition to endothelial cells, can facilitate plaque formation at predilection sites."

Disruption of PTEN in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-NIC model system dramatically accelerated the formation of multifocal and highly metastatic mammary tumors, which exhibit homogenous pathology.  PTEN-deficient/NIC tumorigenesis was associated with an increase in angiogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of PTEN in the MMTV-NIC mouse model resulted in hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. However, like the parental strain, tumors obtained from PTEN-deficient/NIC mice displayed histopathological and molecular features of the luminal-like subtype of breast cancer.  Taken together, our findings provide important implications in understanding the molecular determinants of mammary tumorigenesis driven by PTEN deficiency and ErbB-2 activation, and could provide a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target these critical signalling pathways."

Mutant mice displayed behaviors relevant to schizophrenia, including impairments in prepulse inhibition, sociability and spatial discrimination.  Behavioral deficits were rescued by D-serine and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, and were conversely, amplified by NMDAR inhibition.  Expression profiling revealed that the Srr mutation influenced several genes that have been linked to schizophrenia and cognitive ability.  Furthermore, analysis of Srr genetic variants in humans identified a robust association with schizophrenia.  This study demonstrates that aberrant serine racemase function and diminished D-serine may contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis, and that D-serine may be a beneficial form of treatment"

Distinct global gene expression profiles are associated with anchorage-independent colonies arising from bFGF-stimulated JB6 cells, relative to colonies arising from fully tumorigenic JB6 cells (RT101), including genes exhibiting reciprocal regulation patterns.  Thus, while TPA exposure results in commitment to an irreversible and tumorigenic AIG phenotype, the AIG response to bFGF is reversible with essentially complete restoration of normal cell cycle check point control following removal of bFGF from growth medium.  These results are consistent with the physiological role of bFGF in promoting wound healing, and suggest that natural mechanisms exist to reverse transformative cellular phenotypes associated with carcinogenesis."

DM r is 2 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Diabetes mellitus [DM], with its burden of premature morbidity and mortality, represents one of the major threats to human health in the 21st century (Zimmet 2001). Accelerated atherosclerosis affecting arteries that supply the heart, brain and lower extremities is responsible for an increased risk of acute ischemic events. DM is also associated with microvascular disease, which is a leading cause of blindness, renal failure and debilitating neuropathies. Endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular permeability and microvascular cell loss by apoptosis are all hallmarks of diabetic microangiopathy. Diabetic patients not only incur cardiovascular complications more frequently, but also experience worse outcomes due to attenuation of vascular repair mechanisms. This impairment includes quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of bone marrow [BM]-derived progenitor cells (Emanueli 2002&2004; Loomans 2004; Krankel 2005; Fadini 2006). The mechanisms underlying BM dysfunction remain however enigmatic, especially when considering the privileged location that protects stem cells [SC] and progenitor cells [PC] of the marrow from external insults (Kopp 2008 and Kiel 2008). BM endothelial cells [EC] are instead an obvious target of DM, because they are directly exposed to blood glucose and incapable to regulate glucose influx. Strangely enough, little is known about the impact of diabetes on BM microvasculature. We hypothesize that damage induced by DM might start at the microvascular level, in a similar fashion to microangiopathy, which occurs in kidney, retina, heart and brain. We also propose that enduring microvascular cell loss might result in marrow hypo-perfusion and destabilization of SC homeostasis."

Found induced in !Series_overall_design	"In order to test this hypothesis, we studied streptozotocin-induced (STZ) type-1 DM and age-matched non-DM mice (n=6 to 10 per group in each experiment). Histological examination of femurs, collected from STZ-mice at 28-30 weeks from induction of DM or controls, showed remarkable differences in bone density and marrow composition. Bone marrow cells from healthy and diabetic animals were next selected for endothelial progenitors and cultured for 10 days under endothelial cell growth conditions. Next RNA was isolated and analysed by Illumina Sentrix Beadarrays."

AU r is 3 
Found stimulation in !Series_summary	"The inflammatory response plays out over time in a reproducible and organized manner after an initiating stimulus. Here we showed that the genes activated in cultured mouse fibroblasts in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor can be divided roughly into three groups, each with different induction kinetics. Whereas differential transcription is important in determining the grouping of these genes, differential mRNA stability also exerted strong influence in some cases overriding that of transcriptional control elements on the temporal order of gene expression. mRNA transcripts expressed early after TNF stimulation have abundant AU-rich elements in their 3'-untranslated regions whereas those expressed later are contain fewer AU-rich sequences. Thus mRNA stability and transcriptional control, two intrinsic characteristics of genes, control the kinetics of proinflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression."

NEDD8 r is 7 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) are directed to targets by cascades of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. The largest ubiquitin E3 subclass consists of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which contain one each of several cullins (CUL1, -2, -3, -4, or -5) and RING proteins (RBX1 or -2). CRLs are activated by ligation of the UBL NEDD8 to a conserved cullin lysine. How is cullin NEDD8ylation specificity established? Here we report that, like UBE2M (also known as UBC12), the previously uncharacterized E2 UBE2F is a NEDD8-conjugating enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and structural analyses indicate how plasticity of hydrophobic E1-E2 interactions and E1 conformational flexibility allow one E1 to charge multiple E2s. The E2s have distinct functions, with UBE2M/RBX1 and UBE2F/RBX2 displaying different target cullin specificities. Together, these studies reveal the molecular basis for and functional importance of hierarchical expansion of the NEDD8 conjugation system in establishing selective CRL activation."

Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and de novo crypt formation on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the CBC stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate."

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"DNA methylation is a major epigenetic factor regulating genome reprogramming, cell differentiation, developmental gene expression.  To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS."

We discovered that activation of Fgf receptor- and Wnt-pathways contribute to increased Ffg23 gene transcription in Hyp bone. We found evidence in Hyp bone for increased expression of Fgf1, Fgf7, and Egr2 in the Fgf-signaling pathway and decrements in Sost and Cpz and increments in Sfrp1 and 4 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Fgf and Wnt-signaling stimulated, whereas Tgf β inhibited Fgf23 promoter activity in osteoblasts. We also observed reductions in Bmp1, a metalloproteinase that metabolizes the Fgf23 regulatory extracellular matrix protein Dmp1. These findings suggest that elevation of Fgf23 expression in osteocytes is regulated by interactions between cell surface expression of Phex, extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine effects of Fgf and Wnt. Alterations were also found in enzymes regulating the posttranslational processing and stability of Fgf23, including decrements in the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 and the proprotein convertase Pcsk5. In addition, we found that the Pcsk5 and the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 were decreased in Hyp bone, suggesting that reduced post-translational processing of FGF23 may also contribute to increased Fgf23 levels in Hyp mice. With regards to mineralization, we identified additional candidates to explain the intrinsic mineralization defect in Hyp osteoblasts, including increases in the mineralization inhibitors Mgp and Thbs4, as well as increases in local pH altering factors, carbonic anhydrase 12 (Car12) and 3 (Car3) and the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). These studies demonstrate the complexity of gene expression alterations in bone that accompanies inactivating Phex mutations and identify novel pathways that may coordinate Fgf23 expression and mineralization of extracellular matrix in Hyp bone."

To examine potentially important downstream pathways linked to EBSS-induced starvation and p38 MAP kinase activation, a full genome microarray representing over 41,000 mouse genes or transcripts was probed with cDNA isolated from J774A.1 macrophages that were treated with EBSS, EBSS supplemented with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 or control medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum."

Using cells T cell obtained from normal C57BL/6 mice and mice harboring Treg cells with impaired IL-2R signaling, gene expression profiling revealed many targets in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2-dependent and a substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent targets in Treg cells is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2.

Found lacking in !Series_summary	"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. Upon injury these cells are induced to proliferate in order to quickly re-establish homeostasis. The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFNα), HSCs efficiently exit G0 and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFNα treatment by increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt, expression of IFNα target genes and up-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). HSCs lacking either the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), STAT1 or Sca-1 are insensitive to IFNα stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFNα induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU1, HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFNα and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-FU exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFNα are functionally compromised and are rapidly out competed by non-activatable IFNAR-/- cells in competitive repopulation assays. In summary, while chronic activation of the IFNα pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFNα treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFNα on leukemic cells and raise the possibility for novel applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells. "

Initial force production (1.6 + 0.1 g/g body weight) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon completion of the study.  An immediate-early growth response was present in the EDL (FOS, JUN, ATF3, MAFK) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus.  Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A, 2B; troponins T3, I; alpha-tropomyosin, m-creatine kinase) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain slow/1beta, troponin C, tropomyosin 3gamma) in the EDL.  Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration or myofiber damage in stimulated vs. control muscles. Several fiber type specific transcription factors (EYA1, TEAD1, NFATc1 and c4, PPARG, PPARGC1alpha and beta, BHLHB2) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (KLF4, SOX17, TCF15, PKNOX1, ELAV). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or the genes activated during our parallel studies of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (CYCLINS A2, B2, C, E1, MyoD) increased in the stimulated muscles.

Found loss of in !Series_summary	"Most metabolic studies are conducted in male animals; thus, the molecular mechanism controlling gender-specific pathways has been neglected, including sex-dependent responses to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Here we show that PPARalpha has broad female-dependent repressive actions on hepatic genes involved in steroid metabolism and inflammation. In males, this effect is reproduced by the administration of synthetic PPARalpha ligand. Using the steroid hydroxylase gene Cyp7b1 as a model, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of this PPARalpha-dependent repression. Initial sumoylation of the ligand-binding domain of PPARalpha triggers the interaction of PPARalpha with the GA-binding protein alpha bound to the target promoter. Histone deacetylase is then recruited, and histones and adjacent Sp1-binding site are methylated. These events result in the loss of Sp1-stimulated expression, and thus the down-regulation of Cyp7b1. Physiologically, this repression confers protection against estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, paving the way for a novel therapy against the most common hepatic disease during pregnancy."

We identify the chemokines CCL6 and CCL9 as genes prominently induced by the Type I Interferons and ICSBP, and demonstrate that these immunomodulators are required for the immunoprotective effect of ICSBP expression. Insights into the role of these chemokines in the anti-leukemic response of interferons suggest new strategies for immunotherapy of CML. "

Glis3zf/zf mice develop ductal cysts with decreased number of primary cilia, while the acini are not significantly affected. Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of terminal hormonal genes and several transcription factors important in endocrine development were significantly deregulated in Glis3zf/zf mice. During pancreatic development, Glis3 mRNA expression is induced during the secondary transition, a stage of cell lineage specification and extensive patterning. Changes in pancreatic development of Glis3zf/zf mice are noted during and after this stage; the number of cells staining positively for Ngn3, MafA, or Pdx-1 is greatly diminished.

Histopathological analysis showed that Glis3zf/zf mice develop a pancreatic phenotype with a dramatic loss of beta- (insulin) and delta- (somatostatin) cells contrasting a smaller relative loss of alpha- (glucagon), PP- (pancreatic polypeptide), and epsilon- (ghrelin) cells. Glis3zf/zf mice develop ductal cysts with decreased number of primary cilia, while the acini are not significantly affected. Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of terminal hormonal genes and several transcription factors important in endocrine development were significantly deregulated in Glis3zf/zf mice. During pancreatic development, Glis3 mRNA expression is induced during the secondary transition, a stage of cell lineage specification and extensive patterning. Changes in pancreatic development of Glis3zf/zf mice are noted during and after this stage; the number of cells staining positively for Ngn3, MafA, or Pdx-1 is greatly diminished. These observations indicate that Glis3 plays a key role in the development of mature beta cells."

Eps8 r is 3 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"In a variety of organisms, including mammals, caloric restriction improves metabolic status and lowers the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, ultimately leading to increased lifespan. Here we show that knockout mice for Eps8, a regulator of actin dynamics, display reduced bodyweight, partial resistance to age- or diet-induced obesity, and overall improved metabolic status. We present evidence that these phenotypes, which are associated to increased lifespan in the Eps8 null mice, are due to caloric restriction. This, in turn, is caused by reduced intestinal fat absorption, due to altered morphogenesis of microvilli in intestinal enterocytes. In the nematode, genetic removal of Eps8, causes a microvillar phenotype, indistinguishable from that observed in mice, which leads to early larval lethality. By exploiting the nematode model system, we demonstrate here that the actin bundling activity of Eps8 is indispensable for viability and proper intestinal morphogenesis. This result links a precise molecular function of Eps8 to proper microvillar morphogenesis, and therefore to the phenotype of Eps8-null mice. Our results implicate actin dynamics in individual variations in bodyweight, metabolic status and longevity."

Scl r is 1 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The bHLH transcription factor stem cell leukemia gene (Scl) is a master regulator for hematopoiesis essential for hematopoietic specification and proper differentiation of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. However, the critical downstream targets of Scl remain undefined. Here, we identified a novel Scl target gene, transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (Mef2C) from Sclfl/fl fetal liver progenitor cell lines. Analysis of Mef2C-/- embryos showed that Mef2C, in contrast to Scl, is not essential for specification into primitive or definitive hematopoietic lineages. However, adult VavCre+Mef2Cfl/fl mice exhibited platelet defects similar to those observed in Scl deficient mice. The platelet counts were reduced, while platelet size was increased and the platelet shape and granularity was altered. Furthermore, megakaryopoiesis was severely impaired in vitro. ChIP-on-chip analysis revealed that Mef2C is directly regulated by Scl in megakaryocytic cells, but not in erythroid cells. In addition, an Scl independent requirement for Mef2C in B-lymphoid homeostasis was observed in Mef2C-deficient mice, characterized as severe age-dependent reduction of specific B cell progenitor populations reminiscent of premature aging. In summary, this work identifies Mef2C as an integral member of hematopoietic transcription factors with distinct upstream regulatory mechanisms and functional requirements in megakaryocyte and B-lymphoid lineages."

MuRF1 r is 7 
Found lacking in !Series_summary	"Muscle ring finger (MuRF) proteins have been implicated in the transmission of mechanical forces to nuclear cell signaling pathways through their association with the sarcomere.  We recently reported that MuRF1, but not MuRF2, regulated pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.  This was surprising since MuRF1 and MuRF2 interact redundantly with sarcomeric proteins in yeast two hybrid studies, and form both homo- and hetero-dimers with each other.  To determine if MuRF1 and MuRF2 were functionally redundant during development, we created mice lacking either 3 or 4 of the MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles and compared them functionally.  Surprisingly, only mice missing all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles (MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-) developed a spontaneous hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - mice that were null for one of the genes, but heterozygous for the other (i.e. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2+/- or MuRF1+/-//MuRF2-/-) were phenotypically identical to wild type mice.  Electron microscopy of the hearts of MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-(MuRF1/MuRF2 DN) mice identified altered Z disc and M line architecture, and a distinct swelling of mitochondria. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- mouse hearts displayed increased expression of genes associated with fetal cardiac metabolism, including smooth muscle actin and b myosin heavy chain, suggesting that the cardiac hypertrophy seen in these mice was associated with a reversion to a fetal gene program. Despite our prediction that we would also see an increase in glucose compared to fatty acid oxidation (another trait of fetal cardiac metabolism) we saw that MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- heart homogenates oxidized significantly less glucose compared to controls, suggesting an important role for MuRF1 and MuRF2 in the regulation of glucose metabolism in vivo. This study identifies a previously unreported redundancy in the function of MuRF proteins in normal cardiac development."

BAL r is 7 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"Acute lung injury (ALI), a major cause of acute respiratory failure with high morbidity and mortality, isare characterized by significant pulmonary inflammation and both alveolar and vascular barriers dysfunction.  In Pprior studies have highlighted the role of nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) as an essential element of inflammatory response with MYLK polymorphisms associated withwhich alters ALI susceptibility. In the present study we sought to further define nmMLCK in acute inflammatory syndromes and examined We examined nmMLCK as a molecular target involved in increase of lung epithelial and endothelial barrier permeability. We utilized in two muirine models of inflammatory lung injury: intratracheal administration of endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.5 mg/kg) and VILI (ventilator-induced lung injury, tidal volume 40ml/kg).  Two complementary strategies were used to reduce nmMLCK activity or expression. We found that membrane permeant oligopeptide, PIK, inhibited MLC kinase activity in vitro in aand displayed dose-dependent mannerinhibition of MLC kinase activity.. Intravenous delivery of PIK significantly attenuated LPS-induced lung inflammation reflected by decreasing accumulation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) albumin (~ 50% reduction) as well as reduction in BAL cells, tissue MPO activity and tissue albumin in lung homogenates. A second regulatory approach explored targeting murine nmMLCK by administration of siRNA (5mg/kg) 3 days prior to LPS challenge. siRNA decreased of nmMLCK expression in lungs (~ 70% reduction) and resulted in significant attenuation LPS-induced lung inflammation (~ 40% reduction) as reflected by decreased BAL protein level and BAL cells. For targeting pulmonary vessels nmMLCK we used ACE antibody-conjugated liposomes with nmMLCK siRNA in murine ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) model. Protein silencing of nmMLCK was evident by immunohistochemical analysis with a decrease in relative intensity of fluorescence in lung vessels compared with control animals. Furthermore, the inhibition of nmMLCK expression by siRNA in vessels significantly attenuated VILI lung injury as reflected by decreased BAL protein level (40% reduction). Finally, MLCK knockout mice were significantly protected (reduced BAL protein and albumin) when exposed to a model of severe VILI (4h, 40ml/kg tidal volume). Conclusion: the MLCK gene KO and chemical biology results indicate that the targeting of nmMLCK in vivo attenuate the severity of LPS-induced or VILI acute lung injury."

Mdr2 r is 1 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for Hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it induces tumor recurrence. Our objective was to understand the molecular mechanisms linking liver regeneration under chronic-inflammation to tumorigenesis. Mdr2-knockout mice, a model of inflammation-associated cancer, underwent partial-hepatectomy which led to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Yet, liver regeneration in these mice was severely attenuated. We demonstrate the activation of the DNA damage response machinery and altered genomic instability during early liver inflammatory stages resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and suggest their involvement in tumor recurrence subsequent to partial hepatectomy. We propose that under the regenerative proliferative stress induced by liver resection, the genomic unstable hepatocytes generated during chronic-inflammation, escape apoptosis and reenter the cell-cycle, triggering the enhanced tumorigenesis"

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. The gene responsible for WS is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair. We generated a mouse model with a deletion in the helicase domain of the murine WRN homologue that recapitulates most of the WS phenotypes including an abnormal hyaluronic acid excretion, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increased genomic instability and cancer incidence resulting in a 10-15% decreased life span expectancy. In addition, WS patients and Wrn mutant mice show hallmarks of a metabolic syndrome including premature visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin-resistant diabetes type 2 and associated cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we compared the expression profile of liver tissues from 9 months old Wrn mutant and wild type animals. Gene set enrichment analysis of the microarray data indicated that Wrn mutant mice exhibited down-regulation of genes normally decreased in several transgenic mouse models of hepatoma and during caloric restriction. Wrn mutant mice also altered the expression of genes involved in inflammation as well as in glutathione and xenobiotic metabolisms. These results indicate that Wrn mutant mice respond to the observed oxidative stress by altering the necessary pathways to survive. Vitamin C supplementation rescued the life span expectancy of Wrn mutant mice and reversed several age-related abnormalities in adipose, cardiac, and liver tissues, genomic integrity and inflammatory status. Finally, gene set enrichment analyses revealed that vitamin C decreased genes normally up regulated in human WS fibroblasts and cancers and it increased genes involved in tissue injury response and adipocyte dedifferentiation in obese mice."

Compendium analyses of Cdx2- and the other TF-inducible ES cells suggest a central role of the POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG protein complex in a swift-acting control mechanism to down-regulate a common set of genes at the beginning of multi-lineage ES cell differentiations. These ES cell lines will be a valuable resource to study biological networks in ES cells and mice."

Found inactivation in !Series_summary	"The non-coding Xist RNA triggers silencing of one of the two female X chromosomes during X inactivation in mammals. Gene silencing by Xist is restricted to special developmental contexts found in cells of the early embryo and specific hematopoietic precursors. The absence of critical silencing factors might explain why Xist cannot silence outside these contexts. Here, we show that Xist can also initiate silencing in a lymphoma model. Using the tumor context we identify the special AT rich binding protein SATB1 as an essential silencing factor. We show that loss of SATB1 in tumor cells abrogates the silencing function of Xist. In normal female lymphocytes Xist localizes along SATB1 filaments and, importantly, forced Xist expression can relocalize SATB1 into the Xist cluster. This reciprocal influence on localization suggests a molecular interaction between Xist and SATB1. SATB1 and its close homologue SATB2 are expressed during the initiation window for X inactivation in embryonic stem cells and are recruited to surround the Xist cluster. Furthermore, ectopic expression SATB1 or SATB2 enables gene silencing by Xist in embryonic fibroblasts, which normally do not provide an initiation context. Thus, SATB1 functions as a crucial initiation factor and may act to organize genes for silencing by Xist during the initiation of X inactivation."

To identify DM1-affected genes and study mechanisms for dysregulation, we performed global mRNA profiling in transgenic mice that express CUGexp RNA, as compared to Mbnl1 knockout and Clcn1 null mice. We found that the majority of changes induced by CUGexp RNA in skeletal muscle can be explained by reduced activity of Mbnl1, including many changes that are secondary to myotonia. The pathway most affected comprises genes involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis. Some effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression are caused by abnormal alternative splicing or downregulation of Mbnl1-interacting mRNAs. However, several of the most highly dysregulated genes showed altered transcription, as indicated by parallel changes of the corresponding premRNAs. These results support the idea that trans-dominant effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression in this transgenic model may occur at the level of transcription, RNA processing, and mRNA decay, and are mediated mainly but not entirely through sequestration of Mbnl1."

Found stimulation in !Series_summary	"In skeletal muscle, STAT5a/b transcription factors are critical for normal postnatal growth, whole-animal glucose homeostasis, and local IGF-1 production.  These observations have led us to hypothesize that STAT5a/b are critical for maintenance of normal muscle mass and function.  To investigate this, mice with a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the Stat5a/b genes (Stat5MKO) were used.  Stat5MKO mice displayed reduced muscle mass, altered fiber-type distribution and reduced activity.  On a molecular level, gene expression in skeletal muscle of Stat5MKO and control mice was analyzed by microarrays and real-time PCR, both in the presence and absence of growth hormone (GH) stimulation.  Several genes involved in muscle growth, fiber-type and metabolism were significantly changed.  Specifically in the quadriceps, a muscle almost exclusively composed of type II fibers, the absence of STAT5a/b led to increased expression of several genes associated with type I fibers and the de novo appearance of type I fibers.  Additionally, it is shown here that expression of the androgen receptor gene (Ar) is controlled by GH through STAT5a/b.  The link between STAT5a/b and Ar gene is likely through direct transcriptional regulation, as chromatin immunoprecipitaion of the Ar promoter region in C2C12 myoblasts was accomplished by antibodies against STAT5a. These experiments demonstrate an important role for STAT5a/b in skeletal muscle physiology and they provide a direct link to androgen signaling."

The absence of N-Ras caused significantly higher changes than the absence of H-Ras on the wave of transcriptional activation linked to G0/G1 transition. In contrast, the absence of H-Ras affected more potently the profile of the transcriptional wave detected during mid-G1 progression. Functional analysis demonstrated a predominant functional association of H-Ras with growth and proliferation, whereas N-Ras exhibited a closer functional link to development or cell cycle regulation as well as immunomodulation and apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis indicated that ERK-dependent activation of Stat1 mediates the regulatory effect of N-Ras on defense and immunity, whereas the pro-apoptotic effects of N-Ras are mediated through ERK and p38 signaling.

Our observations support previous reports of an absolute requirement for different peaks of Ras activity during the initial stages of the cell cycle and confirm the notion of functional specificity for the H-Ras and N-Ras isoforms."

Found activation in !Series_summary	"The similarity of transcription profiles among serum-starved fibroblasts of all different WT and ras knockout genotypes tested, indicated that H-Ras and N-Ras do not play significant roles in control of transcriptional responses to serum deprivation stress. In contrast, genomic disruption of H-ras or N-ras, individually or in combination, determined highly specific, differential gene expression profiles in response to post-starvation stimulation with serum for 1 hour (G0/G1 transition) or for 8 hours (mid-G1 progression). The absence of N-Ras caused significantly higher changes than the absence of H-Ras on the wave of transcriptional activation linked to G0/G1 transition. In contrast, the absence of H-Ras affected more potently the profile of the transcriptional wave detected during mid-G1 progression. Functional analysis demonstrated a predominant functional association of H-Ras with growth and proliferation, whereas N-Ras exhibited a closer functional link to development or cell cycle regulation as well as immunomodulation and apoptosis.

Spdef r is 1 
Found loss of in !Series_summary	"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stems cells within the intestinal epithelium generate daughter cells which undergo lineage commitment and maturation through the concerted action of the Wnt and Notch signalling cascades. Both pathways, in turn, regulate transcription factor networks which further define differentiation towards either enterocytes or one of three secretory cell lineages (Paneth, goblet or enteroendocrine cells). In this manuscript, we identified the Ets domain transcription factor, Spdef, as a novel lineage maker of goblet and Paneth cells. METHODS: To address the function of Spdef in vivo, we inactivated the Spdef gene and analysed the intestinal phenotype using a range of histological techniques and DNA microarray profiling. RESULTS: In accordance with the expression data we found that loss of Spdef severely impaired the maturation of goblet and Paneth cells and conversely lead to an accumulation of immature secretory progenitors. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that Spdef positively and negatively regulates a specific subset of goblet and Paneth cell genes including Cryptdins, Mmp7, Ang4, Kallikreins, and Muc2. CONCLUSION: We propose a model whereby Spdef acts downstream of Math1 to promote terminal differentiation of a secretory progenitor pool towards Paneth and goblet cells."

Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Methods: Beginning at 8 weeks of age, male Tie2-GFP mice (transgenically expressing green fluorescent protein exclusively within the endothelia) were fed a 60% fat calorie diet (Bio-Serv #S3282); age-matched mice were fed normal chow. After 4, 6, and 8 weeks on the diet, aortae and skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, and plantaris) were excised, minced, and collagenolytically digested. Each tissue digest was then subjected to FACS in order to obtain 10,000 endothelial cells. Transcriptomic analyses were performed with microarrays containing the Operon Murine V4 oligo set, and highly dysregulated genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. Results: By 4 weeks, Tie2-GFP mice receiving a high fat diet exhibited a fasting glucose of 215+17 mg/dL vs. 134+23 mg/dL in controls; by 6 weeks, a high fat diet resulted in lower glucose tolerance vs. control diet. Following 4, 6, and 8 weeks of high-fat regimen, aortic endothelial transcripts up-regulated by greater than 2-fold in biologically replicate experiments included macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Endothelial transcripts up-regulated in skeletal muscle included Mip2, CCL8 and 9, FLAP, gal-1 and 3, and ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1); transcripts down-regulated in muscle included endothelin-1 (ET-1) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II). Discussion: Gal-3 and FTL-1 are known to increase in response to advanced glycation end-products and oxidized LDL, respectively. However, the down-regulation of ET-1 and IGFII was surprising, as the transcription of these genes has previously been thought to exacerbate atherosclerosis. In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the endothelial transcript-level response to a dietary model of Type II diabetes has revealed novel regulation of transcripts with roles in inflammation, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanism of diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction may lead to improved therapies that lower the risk of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. "

PPARalpha r is 1 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, is detected in consumer’s body fluids. Contamination occurs through environmental and food chain sources. In mouse liver, DEHP activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and regulates the expression of its target genes. Several in vitro investigations support the simultaneous recruitment of additional nuclear receptor pathways.  We investigated, in vivo, the hepatic impact of low doses of DEHP on PPARalpha activation, and the putative activation of additional signalling pathways. Wild-type and PPARalpha-deficient mice were exposed to different doses of DEHP. Gene expression profiling delineated the role of PPARalpha and revealed a PPARalpha-independent regulation of several prototypic Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) target genes.   This finding demonstrates that CAR also represents a transcriptional regulator sensitive to phthalates. CAR-mediated effects of DEHP provide a new rationale for most endpoints of phthalates toxicity described previously, including endocrine disruption, hepatocarcinogenesis and the metabolic syndrome."

PPARalpha r is 1 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, is detected in consumer’s body fluids. Contamination occurs through environmental and food chain sources. In mouse liver, DEHP activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and regulates the expression of its target genes. Several in vitro investigations support the simultaneous recruitment of additional nuclear receptor pathways.  We investigated, in vivo, the hepatic impact of low doses of DEHP on PPARalpha activation, and the putative activation of additional signalling pathways. Wild-type and PPARalpha-deficient mice were exposed to different doses of DEHP.

PPAR-alpha r is 4 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Hepatic metabolic derangements are key components in the development of fatty liver, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, is an important regulator of energy homeostasis in response to nutrient availability. Here we demonstrate that hepatic SIRT1 regulates fatty acid metabolism by positively regulating PPAR-alpha. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 impairs PPAR-alpha signaling and decreased fatty acid beta-oxidation in the liver. When challenged with a high-fat diet, liver-specific SIRT1 knockout mice develop hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, our data indicate that SIRT1 plays a vital role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis."

Found KO in !Series_overall_design	"ix Lox control and six Liver-specific SIRT1 KO (SIRT1 LKO) mice in 95% C57BL/6 background were fed ad libitum with free access to water and food. They were then sacrificed at 4:00pm to analyze PPAR-alpha mediated phenotypes under physiologically relevant conditions. Livers from these mice were then dissected and RNA was isolated with a Qiagen RNA easy mini kit with on-column DNAseI treatment. RNA quality was validated with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer in the microarray facility. RNA samples were then pooled with 2 animals/replicate and analyzed by Agilent Whole Mouse arrays. Data are generated by the Rosetta Resolver Error Model."

TNF-alpha r is 1 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Although natural antibodies (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection, and whether they have housekeeping functions. We now show that the prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a previously unknown type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells, and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes. This T15-NAb-mediated process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide “eat me” signals for phagocytic clearance. Further investigation revealed that, the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro macrophage LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, as well as in vitro Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also inhibited in vivo TLR–induced pro-inflammatory responses, and could suppress autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways."
