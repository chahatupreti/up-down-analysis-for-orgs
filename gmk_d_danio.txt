Adult male and female zebrafish were maintained under normoxia (7 mg O2/L), moderate hypoxia (3 mg O2/L) and severe hypoxia (1 mg O2/L) for 4 and 14 days (n = 5 per treatment) and changes in gene expression in gonadal tissues were evaluated using a commercial 21,000 gene zebrafish oligonucleotide microarray. Differentially expressed genes were determined using ANOVA (p < 0.01), and enriched gene ontology (GO) categories (p < 0.05) identified using GeneSpring GX software (Agilent, USA). Short-term (4 d) exposure to hypoxia affected expression of genes associated with the initial adaptive responses such as: metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, nucleotide metabolism, haemoglobin synthesis, reactive oxygen species metabolism and locomotion. More prolonged (14 d) hypoxia affected a suite of genes belonging to different GO categories: lipid metabolism, reproduction (e.g., steroid hormone synthesis), and immune responses (cytokine synthesis). The results of the present study demonstrate that reproduction likely would be affected by hypoxia via multiple modes of action. These include previously hypothesized mechanisms such as inhibition of steroidogenesis via modulation of expression of steroidogenic genes, and downregulation of serotonergic pathway. But, in addition to these, we propose that there are multiple other points of disruption of reproductive system function linked, for example, to reorganization of lipid transport and other mechanisms involved in responding to hypoxia (e.g., hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase alterations, downregulation of contractile elements etc.).

Starvation affected the expression of 574 transcripts in the liver, indicating an overall decrease in metabolic activity, reduced lipid metabolism, protein biosynthesis and proteolysis, and cellular respiration, and increased gluconeogenesis.  Starvation also regulated expression of many components of the Unfolded Protein Response, the first such report in a species other than yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mice (Mus musculus).  The response of the zebrafish hepatic transcriptome to starvation was strikingly similar to that of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but very different from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and mouse.  The transcriptome of zebrafish whole brain was much less affected than the liver, with only two differentially expressed genes, both down-regulated.  Down-regulation of one of these genes, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9), suggests increased inhibition of apoptosis (neuroprotection) and decreased restructuring of the extracellular matrix in the brain of starved zebrafish.  The low level of response in the transcriptome of whole zebrafish brain agrees with observations that the brain is metabolically protected compared to the rest of the body."'

We hypothesized that the TCDD reduction of sox9b expression plays an integral role in affecting formation of the embryonic jaw.
