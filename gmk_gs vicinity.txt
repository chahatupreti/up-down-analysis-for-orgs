Found -/- in !Series_summary	"Infection by attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens poses a serious threat to public health, as was highlighted by the recent outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection in the United States. Here, by using a murine A/E pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, we demonstrate that C. rodentium infection is lethal to IL-22-/- mice within two weeks. IL-22, in the early phase of infection, is indispensable for preventing the invasion of bacteria through the intestinal epithelium, and thereby preventing systemic spread and mortality.  We also show that IL-23 is required for the early induction of IL-22 during C. rodentium infection. Finally, our data suggest that IL-22 exerts its function by boosting the innate immune responses of colonic epithelial cells, especially though the induction of anti-microbial proteins, RegIIIβ and RegIIIγ."

Found null in !Series_summary	"Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology. In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver. The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner. The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways. p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD."

G1E-ER4 is a sub-line stably expressing an estrogen-activated form of GATA-1 (GATA-1 fused to the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor).  Treatment of G1E-ER4 cells with estradiol induces a GATA-1-regulated program of gene expression with concomitant cellular maturation.  We used a microarray to evaluate the expression of 292 different miRNAs in G1E-ER4 cells at 0 versus 24 hours after GATA-1 activation.

These results document an important role for AP-2γ in skin development, and reveal the existence of regulatory factors that can compensate for AP-2γ in its absence."

Using Irf-4,8-/- pre-B cells we demonstrate that two pathways converge to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, a process that is not simply activated by cell cycle exit. One pathway is directly dependent on IRF-4, whose expression is elevated by pre-BCR signaling.  IRF-4 targets the κ 3′ and λ enhancers to increase locus accessibility and positions a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other pathway is triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and results in activation of the κ intronic enhancer via binding of the transcription factor, E2A. Intriguingly, IRF-4 regulates the expression of CXCR4 and promotes the migration of pre-B cells in response to the chemokine CXCL12.

Despite these advances, however, further progress in our mechanistic understanding of progesterone’s involvement in mammary morphogenesis and tumorigenesis is contingent upon defining the essential effector pathways responsible for transducing the progesterone signal into a mammary proliferative and/or pro-survival response.  Toward this goal, a judiciously chosen acute progesterone treatment regimen together with microarray methods was applied to the mammary gland of the normal mouse to uncover new effectors that operate immediately downstream of the progesterone mammary signal.  Examination of the resultant progesterone-responsive transcriptome disclosed “inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding 4” (Id4) as a molecular target acutely induced by progesterone in the murine mammary epithelium."

Moreover, there was a striking induction of genes associated with endocardial cushions and mesenchyme. Using gain-of-function models, we found that in the developing heart both Tbx2 and Tbx3 induce ectopic Bmp2 and Tgfb2 expression and endocardial cushion formation. Analysis of compound Tbx2/Tbx3 mutant embryos revealed that upon loss of more than two functional alleles, expansion of the AV myocardium does not occur and AV cushions fail to form."

When catecholamine-deficient [tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) null] mouse fetuses die at E13.5-E14.5, they resemble wild type fetuses exposed to hypoxia. They exhibit bradycardia (28% reduction in heart rate), thin ventricular myocardium (20% reduction in tissue), epicardial detachment, and death with vascular congestion, hemorrhage and edema. At E12.5, prior to the appearance of morphological deficits associated with Th deletion, catecholamine-deficient fetuses are preferentially killed by experimentally-induced hypoxia and have lower tissue pO2 than wild type siblings.  Catecholamine-deficient fetuses also induced HIF-1 target genes to a greater extent than wild type siblings, supporting the notion that null fetuses experience greater hypoxia or have an enhanced response to hypoxia. Hypoxia induces a 13-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine levels, which would be expected to increase heart rate, thereby, improving oxygen delivery in wild type mice. Surprisingly, increasing maternal oxygen (FiO2 33% or 63%) prevents the effects of catecholamine-deficiency, restoring heart rate, myocardial mass and survival of Th null fetuses.  We suggest that norepinephrine mediates fetal survival by maintaining oxygen homeostasis as vulnerability to constitutive hypoxia increases as fetal growth accelerates during normal development."

Found expressing in !Series_summary	"IL-2 and IL-21 are closely related cytokines that might have arisen by gene duplication. Both cytokines promote the function of effector CD8+ T cells, but their distinct effects on antigen-driven differentiation of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector CD8+ T cells are not clearly understood. We found that antigen-induced expression of eomesodermin and maturation of naïve CD8+ T cells into granzyme B and CD44 expressing effector CD8+ T cells was enhanced by IL-2, but, unexpectedly, suppressed by IL-21. Furthermore, IL-21 repressed expression of IL-2Ra and inhibited IL-2-mediated acquisition of a cytolytic CD8+ T cell phenotype. Despite its inhibitory effects, IL-21 did not induce anergy, but instead potently enhanced the capacity of cells to mediate tumor regression upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, IL-2, surprisingly, impaired the subsequent anti-tumor function of transferred cells. Gene expression studies revealed a distinct IL-21-program that was characterized phenotypically by increased expression of L-selectin and functionally by enhanced anti-tumor immunity that was not reversed by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL-2. Thus, the efficacy of CD8+ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be influenced by opposing differentiation programs conferred by IL-2 and IL-21, a finding with important implications for the development of cellular cancer therapies."

In the absence of this suppressive activity, B cells developed independently of the obligatory B cell survival factor, BAFF (B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family).  This constitutive, lineage-specific suppression of B cell survival by TRAF2 and TRAF3 determines the requirement for BAFF to sustain B cell development in vivo.  We wished to investigate the effect on gene expression in B cells which lacked the negative regulators TRAF2 and TRAF3, and hence had hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling.  As Baff-tg mice display a similar phenotype, and have a genetic modification which acts in the same pathway, yet further up, than TRAF2 and TRAF3, we wished to compare and contrast Baff-tg B cells with TRAF2 and TRAF3 deficient B cells.  This analysis should identify genes that are important in B cell survival."

Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease.

Several studies suggest that the RET/PTC rearrangement is an initiating event in tumorigenesis.

We studied here the sequence of events leading to thyroid cancer in Tg-RP3 and Tg-E7 mice expressing the transgene exclusively in the thyroid under the control of thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter. Both transgenic mice develop thyroid hyperplasia followed by solid differentiated carcinoma in older animals. To understand the different steps leading to carcinoma, we analyzed thyroid gene expression in both strains at different ages (2, 6, 10 months) by microarray technology. Important biological processes were differentially regulated in the two tumor types. In E7 thyroids cell cycle was the most upregulated process; observation consistent with the huge size of these tumors. In RP3 thyroids immunity was the most significantly regulated process, as previously observed in microarray data on human PTC. Interestingly, other human PTC characteristics were also observed in RP3 but not in E7 mouse tumors: similar regulation of several human PTC markers, upregulation of many EGF-like growth factors and finally significant regulation of angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling-related genes. In summary we showed that RP3 contrary to E7 mouse tumors share several important genotypic characteristics with human PTC, observation reinforcing the validity of this model to study human thyroid tumorigenesis.

We treated KIKI mice with a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, compound 106, which substantially increases frataxin mRNA levels in cells from Friedreich ataxia individuals. Treatment increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in chromatin near the GAA repeat and restored wild-type frataxin levels in the nervous system and heart, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and semiquantitative western blot analysis. No toxicity was observed. Furthermore, most of the differentially expressed genes in KIKI mice reverted towards wild-type levels. "

leukemia inhibitory factor r is 7 
Found stimulated in !Series_summary	"During development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are generated from common neural precursor cells (NPCs). However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor STAT3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development."

Rb r is 7 
Found null in !Series_summary	"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CBP/p300 in the activation of ß-catenin/TCF target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the TCF/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling revealed that FHL2 deficiency triggers a broad change of the cell cycle program that is associated with downregulation of several G1/S and G2/M cyclins, E2F transcription factors and DNA replication machinery, thus correlating with reduced cell proliferation. This change also involves downregulation of the negative cell cycle regulators, particularly INK4 inhibitors, which could counteract the decreased expression of cyclins, allowing cells to grow. Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."

Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"Pneumocystis is a pathogen of immunocompromised hosts but can also infect healthy hosts, in whom infection is rapidly controlled and cleared. To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of  C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes.  Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks.   In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40 ligand is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia."

Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"Rationale: While modulation of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) has shown to be a risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension for almost 40 years, there is a lack of in vivo data about the broad molecular effects of pulmonary inhibition of 5HTT. Previous studies have suggested effects on inflammation, proliferation, and vasoconstriction. The goal of this study was to determine which of these were supported by alterations in gene expression in serotonin transporter knockout mice. Methods: Eight week old normoxic mice with a 5-HTT knock-out (5HTT-/-) and their heterozygote(5HTT+/-) or wild-type(5HTT+/+) littermates had right ventricular systolic pressure(RVSP) assessed, lungs collected for RNA, pooled, and used in duplicate in Affymetrix array analysis. Representative genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Results: RVSP was normal in all groups. Only 124 genes were reliably changed between 5HTT-/- and 5HTT+/+ mice. More than half of these were either involved in inflammatory response or muscle function and organization; in addition, some matrix, heme oxygenase, developmental, and energy metabolism genes showed altered expression. Quantitative RT-PCR for examples from each major group confirmed changes seen by array, with an intermediate level in 5HTT+/- mice. Conclusions: These results for the first time show the in vivo effects of 5HTT knockout in lungs, and show that many of the downstream mechanisms suggested by cell culture and ex vivo experiments are also operational in vivo.  This suggests that the effect of 5HTT on pulmonary vascular function arises from its impact on several systems, including vasoreactivity, proliferation, and immune function."

Found deletion in !Series_summary	"The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (Htt) protein is a cause of Huntington’s disease (HD).  Htt is an essential gene as  deletion of the mouse Htt gene homolog (Hdh) is embryonic lethal in mice. Therefore, in addition to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for polyQ-mediated pathology, it is also important to understand the normal function of Htt protein for both basic biology and for HD. To systematically search for a mouse Htt function, we took advantage of the Hdh +/- and Hdh-floxed mice and generated four mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lines which contain a single copy of the Hdh gene (Hdh-HET) and four MEF lines in which the Hdh gene was deleted (Hdh-KO).   The function of Htt in calcium (Ca2+) signaling was analyzed in Ca2+ imaging experiments with generated cell lines.   We found that the cytoplasmic Ca2+ spikes resulting from the activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and the ensuing mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were suppressed in the Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  Furthermore,  in experiments with permeabilized cells we found that the InsP3-sensitivity of Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum was reduced in Hdh-KO cells.  These results indicated that Htt plays an important role in modulating InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling.  To further evaluate function of Htt, we performed genome-wide transcription profiling of generated  Hdh-HET and Hdh-KO cells by microarray.  Our results revealed that 106 unique transcripts were downregulated by more than two-fold with p < 0.05 and 173 unique transcripts were upregulated at least two-fold with p < 0.05 in Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.  The microarray results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for a number of affected transcripts.  Several signaling pathways affected by Hdh gene deletion were identified from annotation of the microarray results.   The unbiased approach used in our study provides novel and unique information about the normal function of Htt in cells, which may contribute to our understanding and treatment of HD."

cyclin r is 8 
Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"Ubiquitination is a post-translational mechanism of control of diverse cellular processes. We focus here on the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7, a recently identified hematopoietic tumor suppressor that can target for degradation several important oncogenes including Notch1, c-Myc and cyclin E. We have generated conditional Fbw7 knock-out animals and inactivated the gene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Deletion of Fbw7 specifically and rapidly affects the HSC compartment in a cell-autonomous manner. Fbw7-/- HSCs show defective maintenance of quiescence, leading to impaired self-renewal and a severe loss of competitive repopulating capacity. Furthermore, Fbw7-/- HSC  are unable to colonize the thymus leading to a profound depletion of T cell progenitors. Deletion of Fbw7 in bone marrow stem cells and progenitors leads to the stabilization of c-Myc, a transcription factor previously implicated in HSC self-renewal. On the other hand, neither Notch1 nor cyclin E are stabilized in the bone marrow of Fbw7 deficient mice. Genome-wide transcriptome studies of Fbw7-/- HSC and hematopoietic progenitors indicate that Fbw7 controls, through the regulation of HSC cell cycle entry, the global transcriptional “signature” that is associated with the quiescent, self-renewing HSC phenotype."

Bmal1 r is 1 
Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

progesterone receptor r is 4 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The lymphatic system is a common avenue for the spread of breast cancer cells and dissemination through it occurs at least as frequently as hematogenous metastasis. Approximately 75% of primary breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and the majority of these maintain receptor expression as lymph node (LN) metastases. However, it is unknown if ER function is equivalent in cancer cells growing in the breast and in the LNs. We have developed a model to assess estrogen responsiveness in ER(+) breast tumors and LN metastases. Fluorescent ER(+) MCF-7 tumors were grown in ovariectomized nude mice supplemented with estradiol. Once axillary LN metastasis arose, estradiol was withdrawn (EWD), for 1 or 4 weeks, or continued, to assess estradiol responsiveness. On EWD, proliferation rates fell similarly in tumors and LN metastases. However, estradiol-dependent ER down-regulation and progesterone receptor induction were deficient in LN metastases, indicating that ER-dependent transcriptional function was altered in the LN. Cancer cells from estradiol-treated and EWD primary tumors and matched LN metastases were isolated by laser capture microdissection. Global gene expression profiling identified transcripts that were regulated by the tissue microenvironment, by hormones, or by both. Interestingly, numerous genes that were estradiol regulated in tumors lost estradiol sensitivity or were regulated in the opposite direction by estradiol in LN metastases. We propose that the LN microenvironment alters estradiol signaling and may contribute to local antiestrogen resistance."

We previously reported that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) leads to splicing of XBP1 mRNA in neurites, and that XBP1 is required for BDNF-induced neurite extension and branching. To search for the molecular mechanisms of how XBP1 plays a role in neural development, comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed in primary telencephalic neurons obtained from Xbp1 knockout mice at embryonic day 12.5. By searching for the genes induced by BDNF in wild type neurons but this induction was reduced in Xbp1 knockout mice, we found that upregulation of three GABAergic markers, somatostatin (Sst), neuropeptide Y (Npy), and calbindin (Calb1), were compromised in Xbp1 knockout neurons. Attenuated induction of Npy and Calb1 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. In neurons lacking in Xbp1, upregulation of GABAergic markers was attenuated.  Impaired BDNF-induced neurite extension in Xbp1 knockout neurons might be mediated by disturbed BDNF-induced differentiation of GABAergic interneurons."

Irg1 r is 7 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Results. Eleven of the 12 most highly upregulated mRNAs related to innate immunity and inflammation. They included mRNAs encoding histidine decarboxylase (the enzyme that synthesizes histamine), interleukin (IL)-6, the cell surface receptors PUMA-g and TREM-1, and the polypeptides Irg1 and PROK-2. MSU crystals induced dramatic rises in these mRNAs in the pouch membrane within 3-8 hours after the surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1beta and TNFalpha) and immediate early gene (Egr-1) transcription, which occurred 1h after crystal injection. MSU crystals induced these mRNAs in cultured macrophages with similar kinetics but lower fold changes. In keeping with their downregulation by MSU crystals according to the microarrays, qPCR confirmed that TREM-2 and granzyme D mRNAs decreased 79% and 94%, respectively, in MSU crystal inflamed membranes."

Abcb4 r is 3 
Found -/- in !Series_summary	"Background. Abcb4 (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-deficient bile and develop sclerosing cholangitis (SC). The cholangitis involves differential hepatic transcription of genes whose products govern inflammation, activation of hepatic stellate cells and fibrosis.  This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that several genes involved in regulation of tissue inflammation and fibrosis display transcription rates that reflect SC disease activity. Methods. Abcb4 (-/-) mice fed cholic acid (CA) display high SC activity and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) fed mice display low SC activity. Differential hepatic transcription of genes was accordingly measured in abcb4 (-/-) mice maintained on CA- and UDCA-supplemented diets using cDNA microarrays. Abcb4 (+/+) mice served as controls. The differential transcription of selected genes was verified by real time polymerase chain reaction. Liver tissue pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring and immunohistochemistry to visualize bile duct cells and activated hepatic stellate cells. Results. Differential transcription of  Ccl2, Ccl20, Cxcl10, Nfκb1, Nfκb2, Tgfβ1, Tgfβ2, Sparc, Ctgf, Lgals3, Elf3, Spp1, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Col1a1, Col1a2 and Col4a1 genes paralleled the differing SC activities of cholic acid- and UDCA-fed abcb4 (-/-) mice. Histopathology scores and immunohistochemistry showed greatly enhanced activation of hepatic stellate cells during high SC activity due to CA feeding. Conclusion. Differential transcription of several genes relating to tissue inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation parallels SC activity in abcb4 (-/-) mice. Data on their differential transcription may be used to gauge SC disease activity. "

To evaluate the effects of hyperthermia on p53-deficient mouse embryos we used microarray approach to find genes modified by deletion of p53 and hyperthermia treatment in day 8.5 mouse embryos to identify genes that may be involved in the mechanisms underlining NTDs and begin to define the developmental role of p53 in the etiology of NTDs.

Found treated in !Series_summary	"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that preferentially differentiate into mesenchymal cells. If they can be dedifferentiated into embryonic stem cell-like cells, they will be a highly attractive source for cell therapy. Cell and egg extracts have been used in a few studies to evaluate nuclear reprogramming, but these have not examined cell pluripotency in any detail. In this study, we used a cell reversible permeabilization method to treat BMSC with Xenopus laevis mitotic egg extract. We observed an upregulation of the pluripotent protein Oct3/4 in BMSCs treated by this extract. We also further evaluated transcriptional changes with a focused stem cell oligonucleotide array. A number of genes involved in the Notch or Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated in BMSC exposed to Xenopus egg extract. In conclusion, our microarray data from BMSCs exposure to egg extracts may provide interesting clues regarding factors involved in nuclear reprogramming. Our approach is an alternative method towards dedifferentiation of cells without genetic modification, which is preferable in the clinical situation."

Multiple biochemical and genomic parameters of inflammatory lung injury indicated GADD45a-/- mice to be modestly susceptible to intratracheal LPS-induced lung injury and profoundly susceptible to high tidal volume ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) with increases in microvascular permeability and levels of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage. Expression profiling of lung tissues from GADD45a-/- mice revealed strong dysregulation in the B cell receptor signaling pathway suggesting involvement of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling components while the wild type controls depicted no observable changes. Western blot analyses of lung homogenates confirmed ~50% reduction in Akt protein levels in GADD45a-/- mice accompanied by marked increases in Akt ubiquitination. Electrical resistance measurements across human lung endothelial cell monolayers with either reduced GADD45a or Akt expression (siRNAs) revealed significant potentiation of LPS-induced human lung endothelial barrier dysfunction which was attenuated by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 transgene. These studies validate GADD45a as a novel candidate gene in inflammatory lung injury and a significant participant in vascular barrier regulation via effects on Akt-mediated endothelial signaling"

Found activation in !Series_summary	"Levels of C/EBPα are low in myeloid blast crisis (BC) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and its expression in p210BCR/ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells induces granulocytic differentiation, inhibits proliferation and suppresses leukemogenesis.  To assess the mechanisms involved in these effects, C/EBPα targets were identified  by microarray analyses.  Upon C/EBPα activation, expression of c-Myb and GATA-2 was  repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL, K562 and CML-BC primary cells but only c-Myb levels decreased slightly   in CD34+ normal progenitors. The role of these two genes for the biological effects of C/EBPα was assessed by perturbing their expression in K562 cells. Expression of c-Myb blocked the proliferation inhibition and differentiation-inducing effects of C/EBPα while c-Myb siRNA treatment enhanced C/EBPα-mediated proliferation inhibition and induced changes in gene expression indicative of monocytic  differentiation. GATA-2 expression suppressed the proliferation inhibitory effect of C/EBPα but blocked in part the effect on differentiation; GATA-2 siRNA treatment had no effects on C/EBPα induction of differentiation but inhibited proliferation of K562 cells, alone or upon C/EBPα activation. In summary, the effects of C/EBPα in p210BCR/ABL -expressing cells depend, in part, on transcriptional repression of c-Myb and GATA-2.  Since perturbation of c-Myb and GATA-2 expression has non identical consequences for proliferation and differentiation of K562 cells, the effects of C/EBPα appear to involve different transcription-regulated targets."

Found -/- in !Series_summary	"Iron is essential for all cells but is toxic in excess, so iron absorption and distribution are tightly regulated.  Serum iron is bound to transferrin and primarily enters erythroid cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (Tfr1).  Tfr1 is essential for developing erythrocytes and reduced Tfr1 expression is associated with anemia.  The transcription factors STAT5A/B are activated by many cytokines, including erythropoietin.  Stat5a/b-/- mice are severely anemic and die perinatally, but no link has been made to iron homeostasis.  To study the function of STAT5A/B in vivo, we deleted the floxed Stat5a/b locus in hematopoietic cells with a Tie2-Cre transgene.  These mice exhibited microcytic, hypochromic anemia, as did lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Stat5a/b-/- fetal liver cells.  Flow cytometry and RNA analyses of erythroid cells from mutant mice revealed a 50% reduction in Tfr1 mRNA and protein.  We detected STAT5A/B binding sites in the first intron of the Tfr1 gene and found that expression of constitutively active STAT5A in an erythroid cell line increased Tfr1 levels.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding of STAT5A/B to these sites.  We conclude that STAT5A/B is an important regulator of erythroid progenitor iron uptake via its control of Tfr1 transcription."

Afp r is 5 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Background & Aims: MiRNAs are small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through imperfect complementarity with target messenger RNAs. The function of miRNA in mammalian organogenesis is largely unknown. Conditional loss-of-function of Dicer, the enzyme that processes precursor miRNA transcripts into their mature, active form, has been shown to cause severe defects in a number of organ systems. Here we address the role of Dicer in liver development and function. Methods: Mice lacking Dicer function in hepatocytes were generated using an Afp-Cre strain to drive deletion of a floxed Dicer allele. Deletion of the flox-dicer allele was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Decreased miRNA levels detected by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed loss of Dicer function. Gene expression microarray analysis was performed on liver RNA from P28 mutant and control mice. Liver sections from mutant and control mice ranging from embryonic stages through 3-4 months of age were examined and liver function tests were performed on adult mice. Results: Mice lacking hepatocyte Dicer function were born alive at the expected frequency, and had grossly normal appearance and behavior. Despite the loss of mature miRNA, hepatic function was normal, as reflected by normal blood gludose, albumin, cholesterol, and bilirubin. However, mutant mice between 2-4 months of age exhibit progressive hepatocyte damage, elevated ALT/AST, with evidence of balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the lobule. Microarray analysis indicates large-scale changes in gene expression, with increased expression of many miRNA targets, as well as imprinted genes. Conclusions: Loss of miRNA processing in the liver at late gestation has a remarkably mild phenotype, suggesting that miRNAs do not play an essential role in hepatic physiology. However, miRNA deficiency results in hepatocyte apoptosis and balanced hepatocyte regeneration. Finally, microarray analysis of gene expression in mutant liver suggests a previously unrecognized role for Dicer in the repression of imprinted genes."

Found knock-out in !Series_summary	"LMX1B is a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor essential for development. Putative LMX1B target genes have been identified through mouse gene targeting studies; however, in the absence of in vivo molecular characterization of their regulation, their identity as direct LMX1B targets remains hypothetical. We describe here the first molecular characterization of LMX1B target gene regulation. A tetracycline-inducible expression system and microarray analysis showed that a subset of NF-kappa B target genes, including IL-6 and IL-8 are upregulated in LMX1B-expressing HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LMX1B binds to the proximal promoter region of IL-6 and IL-8 in vivo, in the vicinity of the characterized kappa B site, and that LMX1B recruitment correlates with an increased NF-kappa B DNA association. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of p65 impairs LMX1B-dependent induction of NF-kappa B target genes, while activation of NF-kappa B activity by TNF-alpha results in a synergistic induction of these genes by LMX1B. IL-6 promoter-driven reporter assays showed that the kappa B site and an adjacent putative LMX1B binding motif are both involved in LMX1B-mediated transcription. Expression of a number of NF-kappa B target genes is affected in the kidney of Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice, thus supporting the biological relevance of the data obtained in the human cell line. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LMX1B directly regulates transcription of a subset of NF-kappa B target genes in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-kappa B."

Results: In this study, dietary EPA reversed the decrease in colon fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression observed in OA-fed Il10-/- compared to C57 mice. Il10-/- mice fed the OA diet showed decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, as well as those involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, compared to C57 mice on the same diet. In contrast, dietary EPA increased the expression of these genes in Il10-/- mice.

Found exposure in !Series_summary	"The growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) promotes the survival and growth of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and stimulates myelopoiesis.  It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  We used kinetic microarray, Northern Blotting and bioinformatics analysis of IL-3 dependent myeloblasts to determine whether IL-3 acts in part by regulating the rate of turnover of mRNA transcripts in specific functional pathways.  Our results indicate that exposure of myeloblasts to IL-3 causes immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function.  Examples include transcripts associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation (pik3cd, myb, pim-1), hematopoietic development (cited2), differentiation control (cdkn1a) and RNA processing (BRF1, BRF2).  A domain in the 3’-utr of IL-6 that mediates IL-3 responsiveness contains AU-rich elements that bind proteins known to modulate mRNA stability, however a known destabilizing protein (AUF1) is shown not to mediate degradation in the absence of IL-3.    These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of this network of transcripts could contribute to growth patterns observed in leukemia."

We report here the characterization of three novel PPARalpha agonists with therapeutic potential for treating dyslipidemia.  These structurally related compounds display potent and selective binding to human PPARalpha and support robust recruitment of coactivator peptides in vitro.  These compounds markedly potentiate chimeric transcription systems in cell-based assays and strikingly lower serum triglycerides in vivo.  The transcription networks induced by these selective PPARalpha agonists were assessed by transcriptional profiling of mouse liver after acute and chronic treatment.  The induction of several known PPARalpha target genes involved with fatty acid metabolism were observed, reflecting the expected pharmacology associated with PPARalpha activation.  We also noted the downregulation of a number of genes related to immune cell function, the acute phase response, and glucose metabolism; suggesting that these compounds may have anti-inflammatory action in the mammalian liver. Taken together, these studies articulate the therapeutic promise of a selective PPARalpha agonist."

Here we show that the cyclic AMP responsive element–binding protein-1 (Creb1)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1) is required for energy balance and reproduction—Crtc1-/- mice are hyperphagic, obese and infertile. Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice; leptin administration increased amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1 stimulated expression of the Cartpt and Kiss1 genes, which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin’s effects on satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing Lepr and these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1 polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, our results indicate that the Creb1-Crtc1 pathway mediates the central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and fertility."

Mouse embryos lacking Insm1 contained half the number of basal progenitors and showed a marked reduction in cortical plate radial thickness. Forced premature expression of Insm1 in neuroepithelial cells resulted in their mitosis occurring at the basal (rather than apical) side of the ventricular zone and induced expression of the basal progenitor marker Tbr2. Remarkably,  these cells remained negative for Tis21, a marker of neurogenic progenitors, and did not generate neurons but underwent self-amplification. Our data imply that Insm1 is involved in the generation  and expansion of basal progenitors, a hallmark of cerebral cortex evolution."

TCR r is 1 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Th2 cells enable humoral immunity and host-defense to parasites. Whereas IL-4 drives Th2 differentiation and IL-2 is important later in this process by augmenting IL4 chromatin accessibility, we demonstrate that IL-2 serves an essential early role in regulating IL-4Rα expression by inducing binding of Stat5a and Stat5b to the IL4ra locus, with sustained binding during Th2 differentiation.  Although IL-4 induces IL-4Rα expression, TCR-induced IL-4Rα expression was unexpectedly normal in ILr-/- but profoundly diminished in IL2-/- T cells. Remarkably, enforced IL-4Rα expression rescued Th2 differentiation in IL2-/- cells. These results reveal a novel function for IL-2, with IL-2 via Stat5 providing an early signal for IL4ra induction, thereby priming cells for Th2 differentiation and promoting/maintaining IL-4Rα expression in Th2-committed cells."

The diabetogenic CD4+BDC2.5 (BDC) T cell clone upon transfer into NOD.scid mice induced destruction of islets of Langerhans leading to diabetes. Administration of a neutralizing antibody to IFN-γ (H22) resulted in long term protection (LTP) from diabetes, with inflammation but persistence of a significant, albeit decreased numbers of β-cells. BDC T cells were a mixture of cells expressing high, intermediate and low levels of the T cell receptor. Clonotype-low BDC T cells were required for LTP. Furthermore, islet infiltrating leukocytes in the LTP mice contained Foxp3+CD4 T cells. Islet inflammation in both diabetic and LTP mice was characterized by heavy infiltration of macrophages. Gene expression profiles indicated that macrophages in diabetic mice were M1-type, while LTP mice contained M2-differentiated. The LTP was abolished if mice were treated with either an antibody depleting CD4 T cells, or a neutralizing antibody to CTLA-4, in this case, only at a late stage. Neutralization of IL-10, TGF-β, GITR or CD25 had no effect. Transfer of only clonotype-high expressing BDC T cells induced diabetes but in contrast, H22 antibodies did not inhibit diabetes. While clonotype high T cells induced diabetes even when IFN-γ was neutralized, paradoxically, there was reduced inflammation and no diabetes if host myeloid cells lacked IFN-γ receptor. Hence, using monoclonal CD4 T cells, IFN-γ can have a wide diversity of roles, depending on the setting of the immune process."

Human ARF is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene, mainly in association with the simultaneous deletion of INK4A.  However, questions remain as to whether loss of ARF alone is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis.  Here we report that mice deficient for Arf are susceptible to accelerated asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma (MM).  MMs arising in Arf (+/-) mice consistently exhibit biallelic inactivation of Arf, but unexpectedly, do not acquire additional recurrent genetic alterations that we previously identified in asbestos-induced MMs arising in Nf2 (+/-) mice.  Array CGH analysis was used to detect a recurrent deletion at chromosome 4C6.  A candidate in this region, Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1), was further explored because it encodes a protein implicated in tumor cell survival and in the pathogenesis of some human tumor types.  We confirmed hemizygous loss of Faf1 and down regulation of Faf1 protein in a series of MMs from Arf (+/-) mice, and then showed that Faf1 regulates TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB signaling, a mechanism previously implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis of human mesothelial cells.  Collectively, these investigations divulge important information regarding the significance of Arf inactivation in MM pathogenesis, and implicate Faf1 as a key component in the TNFalpha/NFkappaB signaling node that has now been independently implicated in the asbestos-induced oncogenesis."

The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells.

Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes.

The gene encoding Sec tRNA (Trsp) is a single-copy gene and its targeted removal in liver demonstrated that selenoproteins are essential for proper function wherein their absence leads to necrosis and hepatocellular degeneration. In the present study, we found that the complete loss of selenoproteins in liver was compensated for by an enhanced expression of several phase II response genes and their corresponding gene products. The replacement of selenoprotein synthesis in mice carrying mutant Trsp transgenes, wherein housekeeping, but not stress-related selenoproteins are expressed, led to normal expression of phase II response genes. Thus the present study provides evidence for a functional link between housekeeping selenoproteins and phase II enzymes."

Tead2 r is 4 
Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"Regulation of organ size is important for development and tissue homeostasis. In  Drosophila, Hippo signaling controls organ size by regulating the activity of a TEAD  transcription factor, Scalloped, through modulation of its coactivator protein Yki. The  role of mammalian Tead proteins in growth regulation, however, remains unknown.  Here we examined the role of mouse Tead proteins in growth regulation. In NIH3T3  cells, cell density and Hippo signaling regulated the activity of Tead proteins by  modulating nuclear localization of a Yki homologue, Yap, and the resulting change in  Tead activity altered cell proliferation. Tead2-VP16 mimicked Yap overexpression,  including increased cell proliferation, reduced cell death, promotion of EMT, lack of cell  contact inhibition, and promotion of tumor formation. Growth promoting activities of  various Yap mutants correlated with their Tead-coactivator activities. Tead2-VP16 and  Yap regulated largely overlapping sets of genes. However, only a few of the Tead/Yapregulated  genes in NIH3T3 cells were affected in Tead1-/-;Tead2-/- or Yap-/- embryos. Most  of the previously identified Yap-regulated genes were not affected in NIH3T3 cells or  mutant mice. In embryos, levels of nuclear Yap and Tead1 varied depending on cell  types. Strong nuclear accumulation of Yap and Tead1 were seen in myocardium,  correlating with requirements of Tead1 for proliferation. However, their distribution did  not always correlate with proliferation. Taken together, mammalian Tead proteins  regulate cell proliferation and contact inhibition as a transcriptional mediator of Hippo  signaling, but the mechanisms by which Tead/Yap regulate cell proliferation differ  depending on cell types, and Tead, Yap and Hippo signaling may play multiple roles in  mouse embryos."

As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser  microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis. Expression profiling and functional gene group analysis of RNA from WT, HZ, and KO cortex at postnatal day 5 was performed. We identified thousands of transcripts differentially expressed across the genotypes. Verification of selected changes in gene expression was accomplished using in situ hybridization. Our results suggest an adaptive modification in transcript expression of genes involved in cell-cell communication and synaptogenesis. These modifications appear important in forward and reverse signaling as well as maintaining synchrony between the cells. Compensatory up- and down regulation of synapse-associated genes may explain the reverse in HZ phenotype from P7 to P26. Moreover, these findings provide new insight into the role GAP-43 plays in several pathways associated with synaptogenesis and trans-synaptic signaling."

Pten r is 4 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as high-grade disease that typically harbors EGFR, PTEN and Ink4a/Arf mutations, and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and p53 events1.  Here, we show that concomitant CNS-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with striking clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans.  This genetic observation prompted p53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of p53 as well the expected PTEN mutations.  Integrated transcriptomic profling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives elevated c-Myc levels and its associated signature.  Functional studies validated increased c-Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of p53-Pten null NSCs as well as tumor neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model.  c-Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53-Pten null TNSs. These murine modeling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumor suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish c-Myc as a key target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential."

The genetically-engineered ES cell lines were generated to analyze the function of Rex1 in the maintenance of pluripotency and to analyze its gain- and loss-of function. For loss-of-function analysis, we disrupted the endogenous Rex1 allele by conventional gene targeting via homologous recombination in ES cells. The knock-out (KO) allele should be a functionally null allele because the first 100 bp of the open reading frame in the exon 4 including the start codon was replaced by the pacEGFP chimeric gene cassette containing the puromycin-resistant gene (pac) and the green fluorescent protein (Egfp) cDNA. Interestingly, all of the puromycin resistant clones obtained by transfection of this KO vector carried the correctly targeted alleles. One of the Rex1+/- ES cell line (RKPG9) was cultured with high-dose puromycin to obtain the Rex1-/- ES cell lines generated via spontaneous gene conversion. Multiple Rex1-/- ES cell lines were established with extremely high efficiency (4 of 4 clones obtained after the selection were homozygous for Rex1 KO allele). Correct targeting events were confirmed by the loss of the polymorphic signature of the wild-type allele on the southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA, in which the 5.6 kb fragment corresponds to the Rex1 pseudogene on chromosome 15 reported previously as well as found in the mouse genome data. Northern blot revealed the loss of the transcript derived from the wild-type allele in Rex1-/- ES cells, which express the large transcripts composed by the truncated Rex1 and pacEGFP. Rex1-/- ES cells were also established by introduction of the second knockout vector carrying the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker."

Found overexpressing in !Series_summary	"Expression of meningioma 1 (MN1) has been proposed to be a negative prognostic molecular marker in adult AML with normal cytogenetics, however its role in pediatric leukemia is unknown. We found elevated MN1 expression in 53 of 88 pediatric leukemia cases: significant amounts of MN1 were found in immature B-cell ALL and most cases of infant leukemia but no MN1 expression was detected in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Interestingly 17 of 19 cases harboring MLL-X fusions showed also elevated MN1 expression. Lentiviral siRNA mediated MN1 knock-down resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of 3 MLL-X-positive human leukemia cell lines overexpressing MN1 (THP-1, RS4;11, MOLM13). In a mouse MLL/ENL-induced leukemia MN1 overexpression resulted from retroviral provirus insertion. Strikingly co-expression of MN1 with MLL/ENL resulted in significantly reduced latency for induction of an AML phenotype in mice suggesting functional cooperation. MN1 overexpression in MLL/ENL-carrying cells resulted in expansion of the L-GMP population and facilitated disease induction in secondary recipients. Gene expression profiling allowed to define a number of potential MN1 hematopoietic targets. Up-regulation of CD34, FLT3, HLF, or DLK1 was validated in bone marrow transiently overexpressing MN1, in MN1-induced mouse leukemias, as well as in some cases of pediatric leukemias overexpressing MN1. Taken together, our work suggests that MN1 overexpression is essential for growth of leukemic cells, and that MN1 can act as a cooperating oncogene with MLL-X fusion genes most probably through modification of a distinct gene expression program that leads to expansion of a leukemia initiating cell population.

These cells are also pluripotent and can differentiate in vitro and in vivo into the three major embryonic cell lineages. Furthermore, these cells contribute to mouse chimeras and are germline transmissible. In ES cells, Esrrb targets many genes involved in selfrenewal and pluripotency. This suggests that Esrrb may mediate reprogramming through the up-regulation of ES cell-specific genes.

Found + in !Series_summary	"CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells originate primarily from thymic differentiation, but conversion of mature T lymphocytes to Foxp3 positivity can be elicited by several means, including in vitro activation in the presence of TGF-beta. Retinoic acid (RA) increases TGF-beta-induced expression of Foxp3, through unknown molecular mechanisms. We showed here that, rather than enhancing TGF-beta signaling directly in naive CD4(+) T cells, RA negatively regulated an accompanying population of CD4(+) T cells with a CD44(hi) memory and effector phenotype. These memory cells actively inhibited the TGF-beta-induced conversion of naive CD4(+) T cells through the synthesis of a set of cytokines (IL-4, IL-21, IFN-gamma) whose expression was coordinately curtailed by RA. This indirect effect was evident in vivo and required the expression of the RA receptor alpha. Thus, cytokine-producing CD44(hi) cells actively restrain TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 expression in naive T cells, and this balance can be shifted or fine-tuned by RA."

SPARC-null mice have altered basement membranes and develop posterior sub-capsular cataracts with cell swelling and equatorial vacuoles.  Exchange of fluid, nutrients, and waste products in the avascular lens is driven by a unique circulating ion current.  Here we demonstrate that SPARC-null mouse lenses exhibit abnormal circulation of fluid, ion, and small molecules which leads to altered fluorescein distribution in vivo, loss of resting membrane polarization, and altered distribution of small molecules.  Microarray analysis of SPARC-null lenses showed changes in gene expression of ion channels and receptors, matrix and adhesion genes, cytoskeleton, immune response genes, and cell signaling molecules.  Our results demonstrate that the regulation of SPARC on cell-capsular matrix interactions can influence the circulation of fluid and ions in the lens, and the phenotype in the SPARC-null mouse lens is the result of multiple intersecting pathways."

Here, we investigated the phenotype of Rb family triple knock-out (TKO) embryonic stem cells as they differentiate in vivo and in culture. Confirming the central role of the Rb gene family in cell cycle progression, TKO mouse embryos did not survive past mid-gestation and differentiating TKO cells displayed increased proliferation and cell death. However, patterning and cell fate determination were largely unaffected in these TKO embryos. Furthermore, a number of TKO cells, including in the neural lineage, were able to exit the cell cycle in G1 and terminally differentiate. This ability of Rb family TKO cells to undergo cell cycle arrest was associated with the repression of target genes for the E2F6 transcription factor, uncovering a pRb-independent control of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. These results show that the Rb gene family is required for proper embryonic development but is not absolutely essential to induce G1 arrest and differentiation in certain lineages."

Hnrpll r is 8 
Found silencing in !Series_summary	"Immunological Memory is characterized by a heightened recall response to a previously encountered antigen, resulting from clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and differentiation into specialized memory cells. Differentiation of memory B cells involves irreversible encountered antigen, resulting from clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and differentiation into specialised memory cells. Differentiation of memory B cells involves irrversible DNA rearrangements and mutations, but differentiation of memory T cells is less understood. In an ENU screen for mouse mutations affecting the proportion of T cells with known memory cell markers, such as the alternative spliced Ptprc isoform CD45RO, we identified an inducible RNA-binding protein of previously unknown function, hnRNPLL (gene symbol Hnrpll), whose mutation abolishes the regulated silencing of CD45RABC exons in T cells and other leukocytes. In the mutant, a single amino acid substitution destabilizes an RNA-recognition domain that binds with micromolar affinity to RNA containing the Ptprc ARS exon silencing sequence. Hnrpll mutations selectively diminishes T cell accumulation in peripheral lymphoid tissues but not proliferation. Exon array analysis of Hnrpll mutant naive and memory T cells reveals an extensive program of alternative mRNA splicing in memory T cells coordinated by hnRNPLL. A remarkable overlap with alternative splicing in neural tissues may reflect a co-opted strategy of RNA rearrangement for achieving immunological memory in T cells."

VEGFR2 r is 5 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"The molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in relation to adipose tissue metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of mice to cold led to conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown-like adipose tissue, accompanying the switch of an active angiogenic phenotype.  Gene expression profile analysis showed VEGF was upregulated via most likely hypoxia-independent PGC-1 transcriptional activation.  Intriguingly, VEGFR2 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis, significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, and markedly reduced adipose metabolism.  Unexpectedly, VEGFR1 blockage resulted in opposite effects by increasing adipose vascularity and metabolism.  These findings demonstrate that VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 mediate polarized activities in modulating adipose angiogenesis and metabolism. Taken together, our findings have conceptual implications in applying angiogenesis modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders."

We have defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, especially in promoting the enhanced quiescence seen in HSCs that lack the MEF/ELF4 transcription factor. Transcription profiling of HSCs isolated from wild type and p53 null mice identified Gfi-1 and Necdin as p53 target genes and using lentiviral vectors to upregulate or knockdown the expression of these genes, we show their importance in regulating HSC quiescence. Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells."

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

While Ccl17 expression by DCs dampened antigen-specific T cell proliferation, it is required for efficient polarization of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 as reflected by a preponderance of Th2 cytokines in Ccl17-/- Apoe-/- mice. In line with these findings, only transfer of T cells from Apoe-/-, but not from Ccl17-/- Apoe-/- precipitated atherosclerosis in T cell depleted Apoe-/- recipients. These findings identify Ccl17+ DCs as central immune regulators in atherosclerosis and Ccl17 as a potential target in the treatment of this disease."

Using a conditional null allele of the gene encoding p56Lck we show here that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling is also essential for sustaining the phenotype and homeostasis of Treg cells.  Inactivation of p56Lck in Treg cells resulted in large-scale changes in their gene expression profile, blocked their capacity to suppress responses, inhibited their proliferation, and caused them to redistribute in the body.  The results make clear multiple aspects of the Treg cell phenotype that are dependent on a sustained capacity to respond through their TCRs."

We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia.  To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappa-B, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Many of these defects are suppressed by mutation of an activating E2F, E2f1 or E2f3, indicating that they are key downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB. In this study, we assess how E2F4 contributes to the developmental consequences of pRb-loss.  In stark contrast to the activating E2Fs, the homozygous mutation of E2f4 shortened the lifespan of Rb-/- embryos. This resulted from an exacerbation of the placental defect of the Rb-/- mice indicating that E2F4 and pRB cooperate in the development of this tissue. Further analyses indicated that this defect reflects an increase in trophectoderm-like cells. Under conditions where the placenta was wild-type but the embryo mutant for E2f4 and pRb embryos survived to birth and exhibited all of the defects that were observed in the E2f4 and Rb single mutant embryos. Thus, while pRB and E2F4 cooperate in placental development, they play largely non-overlapping roles the development of many embryonic tissues."

Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3).

Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10).

Bmal1 r is 1 
Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."

Dyrk1a r is 1 
Found overexpression in !Series_summary	"The molecular mechanisms that lead to the cognitive defects characteristic of Down syndrome (DS), the most frequent cause of mental retardation, have remained elusive. Here we use a transgenic DS mouse model to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance deregulates chromosomal clusters of genes located near neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) binding sites. We found that DYRK1A binds the SWI/SNF-complex known to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam modifies the transcriptional effect of Dyrk1A-dosage imbalance on L1cam. DyrkA dosage imbalance perturbs Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult neurons. We identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that are responsible for the cellular phenotypic traits present in DS such as dendritic growth impairment and microcephaly during prenatal cortex development. Dyrk1a overexpression in primary mouse cortical neurons reduced the neuritic complexity. In the postnatal hippocampus, DYRK1A overexpression suppresses a form of synaptic plasticity that may be sufficient to cause DS cognitive defects. We propose that DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation generates the brain phenotypic changes that characterize DS, with an accessory role for the gene dosage imbalance of other chromosome 21 genes."

Here we showed that the genes activated in cultured mouse fibroblasts in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor can be divided roughly into three groups, each with different induction kinetics. Whereas differential transcription is important in determining the grouping of these genes, differential mRNA stability also exerted strong influence in some cases overriding that of transcriptional control elements on the temporal order of gene expression. mRNA transcripts expressed early after TNF stimulation have abundant AU-rich elements in their 3'-untranslated regions whereas those expressed later are contain fewer AU-rich sequences. Thus mRNA stability and transcriptional control, two intrinsic characteristics of genes, control the kinetics of proinflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression."

Meis1 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and survival of murine Mll-AF9 leukemia cells. We also observed reduced clonogenic capacity and increased monocytic differentiation. The establishment of leukemia in transplant recipients was significantly delayed by Meis1 knockdown. Gene expression profiling of cells transduced with Meis1 shRNA showed reduced expression of genes associated with cell cycle entry and progression. shRNA mediated knockdown of MEIS1 in human MLL-fusion gene leukemia cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth. These results show that MEIS1 expression is important for MLL-rearranged leukemias and suggest that MEIS1 promotes cell cycle entry.

Found deletion in !Series_summary	"The small intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue of mammals. Proliferative cells are confined to crypts, while differentiated cell types predominantly occupy the villi. We recently demonstrated the existence of a long-lived pool of cycling stem cells defined by Lgr5 expression and intermingled with post-mitotic Paneth cells at crypt bottoms. We have now determined a gene signature for these so called Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) cells. One of the genes within this stem cell signature is the Wnt target Ascl2. Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and de novo crypt formation on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the CBC stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate."

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"DNA methylation is a major epigenetic factor regulating genome reprogramming, cell differentiation, developmental gene expression.  To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS."

Hyp r is 6 
Found activation in !Series_summary	"We used gene array analysis of cortical bone to identify Phex-dependent gene transcripts regulating Fgf23 production and mineralization in Hyp mice. We discovered that activation of Fgf receptor- and Wnt-pathways contribute to increased Ffg23 gene transcription in Hyp bone. We found evidence in Hyp bone for increased expression of Fgf1, Fgf7, and Egr2 in the Fgf-signaling pathway and decrements in Sost and Cpz and increments in Sfrp1 and 4 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Fgf and Wnt-signaling stimulated, whereas Tgf β inhibited Fgf23 promoter activity in osteoblasts. We also observed reductions in Bmp1, a metalloproteinase that metabolizes the Fgf23 regulatory extracellular matrix protein Dmp1. These findings suggest that elevation of Fgf23 expression in osteocytes is regulated by interactions between cell surface expression of Phex, extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine effects of Fgf and Wnt. Alterations were also found in enzymes regulating the posttranslational processing and stability of Fgf23, including decrements in the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 and the proprotein convertase Pcsk5. In addition, we found that the Pcsk5 and the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 were decreased in Hyp bone, suggesting that reduced post-translational processing of FGF23 may also contribute to increased Fgf23 levels in Hyp mice. With regards to mineralization, we identified additional candidates to explain the intrinsic mineralization defect in Hyp osteoblasts, including increases in the mineralization inhibitors Mgp and Thbs4, as well as increases in local pH altering factors, carbonic anhydrase 12 (Car12) and 3 (Car3) and the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). These studies demonstrate the complexity of gene expression alterations in bone that accompanies inactivating Phex mutations and identify novel pathways that may coordinate Fgf23 expression and mineralization of extracellular matrix in Hyp bone."

Upon injury these cells are induced to proliferate in order to quickly re-establish homeostasis. The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFNα), HSCs efficiently exit G0 and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFNα treatment by increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt, expression of IFNα target genes and up-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). HSCs lacking either the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), STAT1 or Sca-1 are insensitive to IFNα stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFNα induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU1, HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFNα and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-FU exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFNα are functionally compromised and are rapidly out competed by non-activatable IFNAR-/- cells in competitive repopulation assays. In summary, while chronic activation of the IFNα pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFNα treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo.

Using standard Affymetrix protocols the RNA samples were analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix mouse 430_2 whole genome microarrays arrays. A threshold value of 50 was set for all genes and the list of genes filtered to include only those that had at least one Present flag (""P"" flag) in one of the 4 conditions. For each gene, the ratio of its expression in a particular condition and its expression in parental BaF3 cells was determined. Only genes that had at least a 3-fold up or down change in expression were considered, leaving a set of 1431 genes for further analysis. K-means clustering with Gene cluster 3.0 was used to group these 1431 genes into 15 clusters and JavaTree was used to visualize the results."

Eps8 r is 3 
Found knockout in !Series_summary	"In a variety of organisms, including mammals, caloric restriction improves metabolic status and lowers the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, ultimately leading to increased lifespan. Here we show that knockout mice for Eps8, a regulator of actin dynamics, display reduced bodyweight, partial resistance to age- or diet-induced obesity, and overall improved metabolic status. We present evidence that these phenotypes, which are associated to increased lifespan in the Eps8 null mice, are due to caloric restriction. This, in turn, is caused by reduced intestinal fat absorption, due to altered morphogenesis of microvilli in intestinal enterocytes. In the nematode, genetic removal of Eps8, causes a microvillar phenotype, indistinguishable from that observed in mice, which leads to early larval lethality. By exploiting the nematode model system, we demonstrate here that the actin bundling activity of Eps8 is indispensable for viability and proper intestinal morphogenesis. This result links a precise molecular function of Eps8 to proper microvillar morphogenesis, and therefore to the phenotype of Eps8-null mice. Our results implicate actin dynamics in individual variations in bodyweight, metabolic status and longevity."

In Pprior studies have highlighted the role of nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) as an essential element of inflammatory response with MYLK polymorphisms associated withwhich alters ALI susceptibility. In the present study we sought to further define nmMLCK in acute inflammatory syndromes and examined We examined nmMLCK as a molecular target involved in increase of lung epithelial and endothelial barrier permeability. We utilized in two muirine models of inflammatory lung injury: intratracheal administration of endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.5 mg/kg) and VILI (ventilator-induced lung injury, tidal volume 40ml/kg).  Two complementary strategies were used to reduce nmMLCK activity or expression. We found that membrane permeant oligopeptide, PIK, inhibited MLC kinase activity in vitro in aand displayed dose-dependent mannerinhibition of MLC kinase activity.. Intravenous delivery of PIK significantly attenuated LPS-induced lung inflammation reflected by decreasing accumulation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) albumin (~ 50% reduction) as well as reduction in BAL cells, tissue MPO activity and tissue albumin in lung homogenates. A second regulatory approach explored targeting murine nmMLCK by administration of siRNA (5mg/kg) 3 days prior to LPS challenge. siRNA decreased of nmMLCK expression in lungs (~ 70% reduction) and resulted in significant attenuation LPS-induced lung inflammation (~ 40% reduction) as reflected by decreased BAL protein level and BAL cells. For targeting pulmonary vessels nmMLCK we used ACE antibody-conjugated liposomes with nmMLCK siRNA in murine ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) model. Protein silencing of nmMLCK was evident by immunohistochemical analysis with a decrease in relative intensity of fluorescence in lung vessels compared with control animals. Furthermore, the inhibition of nmMLCK expression by siRNA in vessels significantly attenuated VILI lung injury as reflected by decreased BAL protein level (40% reduction). Finally, MLCK knockout mice were significantly protected (reduced BAL protein and albumin) when exposed to a model of severe VILI (4h, 40ml/kg tidal volume). Conclusion: the MLCK gene KO and chemical biology results indicate that the targeting of nmMLCK in vivo attenuate the severity of LPS-induced or VILI acute lung injury."

Our objective was to understand the molecular mechanisms linking liver regeneration under chronic-inflammation to tumorigenesis. Mdr2-knockout mice, a model of inflammation-associated cancer, underwent partial-hepatectomy which led to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Yet, liver regeneration in these mice was severely attenuated. We demonstrate the activation of the DNA damage response machinery and altered genomic instability during early liver inflammatory stages resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and suggest their involvement in tumor recurrence subsequent to partial hepatectomy. We propose that under the regenerative proliferative stress induced by liver resection, the genomic unstable hepatocytes generated during chronic-inflammation, escape apoptosis and reenter the cell-cycle, triggering the enhanced tumorigenesis"

Found mutant in !Series_summary	"Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. The gene responsible for WS is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair. We generated a mouse model with a deletion in the helicase domain of the murine WRN homologue that recapitulates most of the WS phenotypes including an abnormal hyaluronic acid excretion, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increased genomic instability and cancer incidence resulting in a 10-15% decreased life span expectancy. In addition, WS patients and Wrn mutant mice show hallmarks of a metabolic syndrome including premature visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin-resistant diabetes type 2 and associated cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we compared the expression profile of liver tissues from 9 months old Wrn mutant and wild type animals. Gene set enrichment analysis of the microarray data indicated that Wrn mutant mice exhibited down-regulation of genes normally decreased in several transgenic mouse models of hepatoma and during caloric restriction. Wrn mutant mice also altered the expression of genes involved in inflammation as well as in glutathione and xenobiotic metabolisms. These results indicate that Wrn mutant mice respond to the observed oxidative stress by altering the necessary pathways to survive. Vitamin C supplementation rescued the life span expectancy of Wrn mutant mice and reversed several age-related abnormalities in adipose, cardiac, and liver tissues, genomic integrity and inflammatory status. Finally, gene set enrichment analyses revealed that vitamin C decreased genes normally up regulated in human WS fibroblasts and cancers and it increased genes involved in tissue injury response and adipocyte dedifferentiation in obese mice."

Xist r is 3 
Found silencing in !Series_summary	"The non-coding Xist RNA triggers silencing of one of the two female X chromosomes during X inactivation in mammals. Gene silencing by Xist is restricted to special developmental contexts found in cells of the early embryo and specific hematopoietic precursors. The absence of critical silencing factors might explain why Xist cannot silence outside these contexts. Here, we show that Xist can also initiate silencing in a lymphoma model. Using the tumor context we identify the special AT rich binding protein SATB1 as an essential silencing factor. We show that loss of SATB1 in tumor cells abrogates the silencing function of Xist. In normal female lymphocytes Xist localizes along SATB1 filaments and, importantly, forced Xist expression can relocalize SATB1 into the Xist cluster. This reciprocal influence on localization suggests a molecular interaction between Xist and SATB1. SATB1 and its close homologue SATB2 are expressed during the initiation window for X inactivation in embryonic stem cells and are recruited to surround the Xist cluster. Furthermore, ectopic expression SATB1 or SATB2 enables gene silencing by Xist in embryonic fibroblasts, which normally do not provide an initiation context. Thus, SATB1 functions as a crucial initiation factor and may act to organize genes for silencing by Xist during the initiation of X inactivation."

Furthermore, they showed antigen-driven Bcl-2 down-regulation and early up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, consistent with the requirement of this BH3-only protein for peripheral T cell deletion. Bim up-regulation was paralleled by defective IL-7Ra chain re-expression, suggesting that Bim-dependent death may be triggered by loss of IL-7/IL-7R signaling. Finally, we observed parallels in molecular signatures between deletion and anergy suggesting that these tolerance pathways may not be as molecularly distinct as previously surmised."

GH r is 2 
Found stimulation in !Series_summary	"In skeletal muscle, STAT5a/b transcription factors are critical for normal postnatal growth, whole-animal glucose homeostasis, and local IGF-1 production.  These observations have led us to hypothesize that STAT5a/b are critical for maintenance of normal muscle mass and function.  To investigate this, mice with a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the Stat5a/b genes (Stat5MKO) were used.  Stat5MKO mice displayed reduced muscle mass, altered fiber-type distribution and reduced activity.  On a molecular level, gene expression in skeletal muscle of Stat5MKO and control mice was analyzed by microarrays and real-time PCR, both in the presence and absence of growth hormone (GH) stimulation.  Several genes involved in muscle growth, fiber-type and metabolism were significantly changed.  Specifically in the quadriceps, a muscle almost exclusively composed of type II fibers, the absence of STAT5a/b led to increased expression of several genes associated with type I fibers and the de novo appearance of type I fibers.  Additionally, it is shown here that expression of the androgen receptor gene (Ar) is controlled by GH through STAT5a/b.  The link between STAT5a/b and Ar gene is likely through direct transcriptional regulation, as chromatin immunoprecipitaion of the Ar promoter region in C2C12 myoblasts was accomplished by antibodies against STAT5a. These experiments demonstrate an important role for STAT5a/b in skeletal muscle physiology and they provide a direct link to androgen signaling."

In contrast, genomic disruption of H-ras or N-ras, individually or in combination, determined highly specific, differential gene expression profiles in response to post-starvation stimulation with serum for 1 hour (G0/G1 transition) or for 8 hours (mid-G1 progression). The absence of N-Ras caused significantly higher changes than the absence of H-Ras on the wave of transcriptional activation linked to G0/G1 transition. In contrast, the absence of H-Ras affected more potently the profile of the transcriptional wave detected during mid-G1 progression. Functional analysis demonstrated a predominant functional association of H-Ras with growth and proliferation, whereas N-Ras exhibited a closer functional link to development or cell cycle regulation as well as immunomodulation and apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis indicated that ERK-dependent activation of Stat1 mediates the regulatory effect of N-Ras on defense and immunity, whereas the pro-apoptotic effects of N-Ras are mediated through ERK and p38 signaling.

The target molecules and mechanisms whereby these neo-epitopes become accessible to recognition are not well understood. Proposing that isolated intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may carry IR-related neo-epitopes, we used in vitro IEC binding assays to screen hybridomas created from B cells of unmanipulated wild type C57BL/6 mice. We identified a novel IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb B4) that reacted with the surface of IEC by flow cytometric analysis and was alone capable of causing complement activation, neutrophil recruitment and intestinal injury in otherwise IR-resistant Rag1-/- mice. Monoclonal Ab B4 was found to specifically recognize mouse annexin IV. Pre-injection of recombinant annexin IV blocked IR injury in wild type C57BL/6 mice, demonstrating the requirement for recognition of this protein in order to develop IR injury in the context of a complex natural antibody repertoire. Humans were also found to exhibit IgM natural antibodies that recognize annexin IV. These data in toto identify annexin IV as a key ischemia-related target antigen that is recognized by natural Abs in a pathologic process required in vivo to develop intestinal IR injury."

Found expressing in !Series_summary	"Methods: Beginning at 8 weeks of age, male Tie2-GFP mice (transgenically expressing green fluorescent protein exclusively within the endothelia) were fed a 60% fat calorie diet (Bio-Serv #S3282); age-matched mice were fed normal chow. After 4, 6, and 8 weeks on the diet, aortae and skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, and plantaris) were excised, minced, and collagenolytically digested. Each tissue digest was then subjected to FACS in order to obtain 10,000 endothelial cells. Transcriptomic analyses were performed with microarrays containing the Operon Murine V4 oligo set, and highly dysregulated genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. Results: By 4 weeks, Tie2-GFP mice receiving a high fat diet exhibited a fasting glucose of 215+17 mg/dL vs. 134+23 mg/dL in controls; by 6 weeks, a high fat diet resulted in lower glucose tolerance vs. control diet. Following 4, 6, and 8 weeks of high-fat regimen, aortic endothelial transcripts up-regulated by greater than 2-fold in biologically replicate experiments included macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Endothelial transcripts up-regulated in skeletal muscle included Mip2, CCL8 and 9, FLAP, gal-1 and 3, and ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1); transcripts down-regulated in muscle included endothelin-1 (ET-1) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II). Discussion: Gal-3 and FTL-1 are known to increase in response to advanced glycation end-products and oxidized LDL, respectively. However, the down-regulation of ET-1 and IGFII was surprising, as the transcription of these genes has previously been thought to exacerbate atherosclerosis. In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the endothelial transcript-level response to a dietary model of Type II diabetes has revealed novel regulation of transcripts with roles in inflammation, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanism of diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction may lead to improved therapies that lower the risk of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. "

Cebpa r is 3 
Found deletion in !Series_summary	"We have previously demonstrated that deletion of the Cebpa gene in the developing fetal mouse lung caused death soon after birth from the failure of lung maturation.  Many of the transcriptional pathways regulating morphogenesis of the fetal lung are induced postnatally and mediate repair of the injured lung.  We hypothesized that C/EBPa plays a role in protection of the alveolar epithelium following hyperoxia injury of the mature lung.  Transgenic Cebpa∆/∆ mice in which Cebpa was conditionally deleted from Clara cells (from early gestation) and type II cells (from near-term) were developed.  Cebpa∆/∆ mice grow normally without any pulmonary abnormalities. Cebpa∆/∆ mice were highly susceptible to hyperoxia. Cebpa∆/∆ mice died within 4d after hyperoxia associated with severe lung inflammation and altered surfactant components at a time when all control mice survived.  Microarrays were analyzed on isolated type II cells at an early stage (24h) of hyperoxia exposure to detect the primary genes influenced by deletion of Cebpa.  The associated network analysis revealed the reduced expression of key genes related to surfactant lipid and protein homeostasis, such as Srebf, Scap, Lpcat1, Abca3, Sftpb, and Napsa.  Genes for the cell signaling, immune response, and protective antioxidants, including GSH and Vnn-1,3, were decreased in the Cebpa∆/∆ mice lung.  C/EBPa did not play a critical role in postnatal pulmonary function under normal conditions.  In contrast, in the absence of C/EBPa, exposure to hyperoxia caused respiratory failure, supporting the concept that C/EBPa plays an important role in enhancing epithelial cell survival, surfactant lipid homeostasis, and maturation of SP-B from pro-SP-B.

When challenged with a high-fat diet, liver-specific SIRT1 knockout mice develop hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

RNA quality was validated with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer in the microarray facility. RNA samples were then pooled with 2 animals/replicate and analyzed by Agilent Whole Mouse arrays. Data are generated by the Rosetta Resolver Error Model."

TNF-alpha r is 1 
Found induced in !Series_summary	"Although natural antibodies (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection, and whether they have housekeeping functions. We now show that the prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a previously unknown type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells, and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes. This T15-NAb-mediated process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide “eat me” signals for phagocytic clearance. Further investigation revealed that, the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro macrophage LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, as well as in vitro Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also inhibited in vivo TLR–induced pro-inflammatory responses, and could suppress autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways."

Th r is 4 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"The catecholamine norepinephrine is required for fetal survival, but its essential function is unknown.  When catecholamine-deficient [tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) null] mouse fetuses die at E13.5-E14.5, they resemble wild type fetuses exposed to hypoxia. They exhibit bradycardia (28% reduction in heart rate), thin ventricular myocardium (20% reduction in tissue), epicardial detachment, and death with vascular congestion, hemorrhage and edema. At E12.5, prior to the appearance of morphological deficits associated with Th deletion, catecholamine-deficient fetuses are preferentially killed by experimentally-induced hypoxia and have lower tissue pO2 than wild type siblings.  Catecholamine-deficient fetuses also induced HIF-1 target genes to a greater extent than wild type siblings, supporting the notion that null fetuses experience greater hypoxia or have an enhanced response to hypoxia. Hypoxia induces a 13-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine levels, which would be expected to increase heart rate, thereby, improving oxygen delivery in wild type mice. Surprisingly, increasing maternal oxygen (FiO2 33% or 63%) prevents the effects of catecholamine-deficiency, restoring heart rate, myocardial mass and survival of Th null fetuses.  We suggest that norepinephrine mediates fetal survival by maintaining oxygen homeostasis as vulnerability to constitutive hypoxia increases as fetal growth accelerates during normal development."

Smad4 r is 3 
Found deficient in !Series_summary	"Results: Among 1419 transcripts significantly modulated by the dietary iron content, four were regulated similarly to the hepcidin genes Hamp1 and Hamp2. They are coding for Bmp6, the regulator of Bmp/Smad signal transduction Smad7, the negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins Id1, and a protein with a bHLH domain, Atoh8. The iron overload developed by Smad4 and Hamp1-deficient mice also increased Bmp6 transcription. Body iron stores influence Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and, as shown by analysis of mice with liver-specific disruption of Smad4, the binding partner for the receptor-activated Smads is necessary for activation of Smad7, Id1, and Atoh8 transcription by iron."
